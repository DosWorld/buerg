                Copyright (c) Vernon D. Buerg 1985,,1986,1987
                        Version 2.20 - June 28, 1987


Purpose:   The SORTF command reads data from an ASCII file,  sorts the
           records, and writes the data to another file.

Format:
           SORTF [d:][path]fname[.ext] [d:][path]fname[.ext]
                 [/+nnn[,len]]
                 [/R] [/C] [/Q]

Remarks:   Records read from  the input  file ending  with a  carriage
           return and  line feed  are considered  logical records  and
           may be up to 256 characters in length.

           The records  are  sorted  into  ascending  ASCII  character
           order unless /R is supplied to reverse the order.

|          Use the  /Q option to suppress the display of informational
|          messages. Error messages can not be suppressed.

           The  /C option may be added to cause  SORTF  to  treat  the
           key fields as case  insensitive data.  That is,  lower case
           letters  in  the  key  field  are  treated  as  upper  case
           letters.

|          You may supply up to sixteen  key offsets  and  lengths  by
|          using the /+ parameter for each key position and length.

           The key is taken from the first character position,  unless
           the  /+  operand is used to specify the location of the key
           within the records.  The position 'nnn' may be a value from
           one to 255.  The first  12 characters at  that position are
           used as the record key unless the  'len' operand is used to
           specify the key length.  The key length may be a value from
           1 to 99.

           For example, to sort a file in  descending  order with  the
           keys in position 10:

                SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10

           Or, to sort the same file using keys with 24 characters:

                SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10,24

           Depending on the amount of  memory available,  up to  40000
           records, or a file up to 16-Mb, may be sorted.

           The advantages of using  SORTF  instead of the SORT filter:
                - files larger than 63K may be sorted
                - less time is required

           For  best  results,  place the  input file  on the  fastest
           available drive, e.g. RAM disk.

           o  Corrects CR/LF problem. Remember, it is assumed that
              all "records" end in a carriage return (CR). Those
              that do not may appear as part of other records to
              a text editor.

        2.1, August 3, 1985
           o  Corrects a problem sorting files larger than 64K.

        2.15, December 27, 1985
           o  Corrects problems with first record of file.
           o  Adds /C option to treat keys as case insensitive data
           o  The key length may be specified on the command line

        2.17, February 25, 1987
           o  Correct problem when maximum records exceeded
           o  Convert to COM program

|       2.20, June 28, 1987
|          o  Add /Q option to suppress informational messages
|          o  Change to allow up to 16 key field specifications
