                    (c) Copyright Vernon D. Buerg 1985-87
                        Version 2.17 - March 2, 1987


Purpose:   The SORTF command reads data from an ASCII file, sorts the
           records, and writes the data to another file.

Format:
           SORTF [d:][path]fname[.ext] [d:][path]fname[.ext]
                 [/+nnn[,len]]
                 [/R]
                 [/C]

Remarks:   Records read from the input file ending with a carriage
           return and line feed are considered logical records and may
           be up to 256 characters in length.

           The records are sorted into ascending ASCII character order
           unless /R is supplied to reverse the order.

           The /C option may be added to cause SORTF to treat the key
           fields as case insensitive data. That is, lower case letters
           in the key field are treated as upper case letters.

           The key is taken from the first character position, unless
           the /+ operand is used to specify the location of the key
           within the records. The position may be a value from one
           to 255. The first 12 characters at that position are used
           as the record key unless the 'len' operand is used to
           specify the key length. The key length may be a value from
           1 to 99.

           For example, to sort a file in descending order with the
           keys in position 10:

                SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10

           Or, to sort the same file using keys with 24 characters:

                SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10,24

           Depending on the amount of memory available, up to 40000
           records, or a file up to 16-Mb, may be sorted.

           The advantages of using SORTF instead of the SORT filter are:
                - files larger than 63K may be sorted
                - less time is required

           For best results, place the input file on the fastest
           available drive, e.g. RAM disk.

Version History:

        2.0, July 11, 1985.
           o  Corrects CR/LF problem. Remember, it is assumed that
              all "records" end in a carriage return (CR). Those
              that do not may appear as part of other records to
              a text editor.

        2.1, August 3, 1985
           o  Corrects a problem sorting files larger than 64K.

        2.15, December 27, 1985
           o  Corrects problems with first record of file.
           o  Adds /C option to treat keys as case insensitive data
           o  The key length may be specified on the command line

        2.17, February 25, 1987
|          o  Correct problem when maximum records exceeded
|          o  Convert to COM program
