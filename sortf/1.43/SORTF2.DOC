-------------

Purpose:   This command reads data from an ASCII file, sorts the
	   records, and writes the data to another file.

Format:    SORTF [d:][path]fname[.ext] [d:][path]fname[.ext] [/R][/+nnn]

Remarks:   Records read from the input file ending with a carriage
	   return and line feed are considered logical records and may
	   be up to 255 characters in length.

	   The records are sorted into ascending ASCII character order
	   unless /R is supplied to reverse the order.

	   The key is taken from the first character position, unless
	   the /+ operand is used to specify the location of the key
	   within the records. The position may be a value from one
	   to 255. The first 12 characters at that position are used
	   as the record key.

	   For example, to sort a file in descending order with the
	   keys in position 10:

		SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10

	   Depending on the amount of memory available, up to 40000
	   records, or a file of 16-Mb, may be sorted.

	   The advantages of using SORTF instead of the SORT filter are:
		- files larger than 63K may be sorted
		- less time is required

	   For best results, place the input file on the fastest
	   available drive, e.g. RAM disk.
