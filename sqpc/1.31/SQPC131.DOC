SQPC Command
-----------------

Purpose:   Create a compressed - SQueezed - copy of a file.

Format:    SQPC  [d:]input[.ext] [d:[\outpath]]  [/D]

Syntax:

           The input  file name  is required.   It may  contain a  drive
        letter, a path name, and wildcard characters.

           The output file specification  is optional.  If omitted,  the
        squeezed  output  file  is  placed  in  the  current path on the
        current  drive.   If  supplied,  the  output  specification  may
        contain a drive letter and path names.  The output filename  and
        extension  are  taken  from  the  input  filename and extension,
        except that the extension for the output extension is changed to
        contain the letter  "Q" as the  middle letter.  This  identifies
        the file as a "squeezed" file.

           If the  input file  name does  not include  an extension, the
        output file name is assigned an extension of "QQQ".

           The output file replaces any existing file of the same name.

|          The /D option specifies the the input files be deleted after
|       they have been squeezed.

Remarks:

           SQPC is derived from the SQ File Squeezer written by  Richard
        Greenlaw.  SQPC was written using assembly language to achieve a
        smaller program file  and to improve  performance.  It uses  the
        same Huffman  encoding algorithm  for creating  a squeezed  file
        from any input file.  Additionally, SQPC allows the use of  path
        names  and  wildcards,  and  it  incorporates the file date/time
        stamp feature employed in the newer version of SQ known as NSQ.

           The squeezed file created by SQPC can be unsqueezed back into
        the original file form by  using the USQ or NUSQ  programs.  The
        original file date and time are preserved by SQPC and NUSQ.

           Compression rates are dependent on the content of the file to
        be squeezed.  For  a typical ASCII  text file, a  compression to
        60% of the original file is common.  For more complex data, such
        as in an EXE file, much smaller compression rates are  expected.
        For small  files, the  rate may  be over  100% because  decoding
        information is included in the squeezed file.

|          If any errors are encountered,  the DOS  ERRORLEVEL  variable
|       is set to a value of 1 (one).

Examples:

        1)  Squeeze  the  file  "PGM.ASM1"  which  is  contained  in   a
           subdirectory call "SOURCE" on drive "A".  Place the  squeezed
           file  in  a  subdirectory  call  "TEST"  on  drive  "B".  The
           squeezed file is called PGM1.AQM.

                A>SQPC A:\SOURCE\PGM1.ASM B:\TEST

        2) Create a squeezed file  for the file called "MEMO.TXT"  which
           is contained in the  current directory in the  current drive.
           Place the squeezed file in the same directory on the  current
           drive.  The squeezed file is called MEMO.TQT.

                A>SQPC MEMO.TXT



        3)  Squeeze  all  files  with  an  extension  of "DOC" which are
           contained in the current  directory on drive "B".   Place the
           output in the current path for drive "A".  The squeezed files
           have an extension of "DQC".

                A>SQPC B:*.DOC A:
