LDIR Command
-----------

Purpose:   To display the files in one or all directories of a disk.

Format:    LDIR  [d:][\path]filespec]  [/?... /?]

Remarks:   If no operands are supplied, the files in the current path
           and in the current directory are displayed. You may specify
           another drive using the d: operand, and/or a path name,
           and/or a file specification. Wildcard characters * and ? are
           permitted in the filespec operand.

           All available memory is used. As many files as fit in memory
           are sorted and displayed.

           The /? refers to optional processing switches. You may use
           one or more of the following:

Sort options:

          /D   sort by file Date
          /F   sort by Filename, this is the default
          /S   sort by file Size
          /X   sort by eXtension

File criteria:

          /A   include Attributes, e.g. S=system, R=readonly, H=hidden
          /H   include files with the Hidden attribute
          /M   display only Modified files, i.e with Archive bit off
          /P   include all Paths starting with the current directory

Display options:

          /C   Clear screen first, and after any "... more" prompts
          /W   Wait after screen full, ask for any key after 20 lines displayed
          /?   display usage syntax



Examples:
           - Display all files, in filename order, on the current drive:

                LDIR

           - Display all files in the subdirectory \TEST\PGMS on drive B:

                LDIR B:\TEST\PGMS

           - Display only those files with an extension of .COM

                LDIR *.COM

           - Display all modified files in all subdirectories on current drive

                LDIR /M/P
