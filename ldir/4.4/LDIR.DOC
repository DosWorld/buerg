LDIR Command							   Version 4.4
-----------							   Mar 25, 1991

Purpose:   To display the files in one or all directories of a disk.

Format:    LDIR  [d:][\path]filespec]  [/?... /?]

Remarks:   If no operands are supplied, the files in the current path
	   and in the current directory are displayed. You may specify
	   another drive using the d: operand, and/or a path name,
	   and/or a file specification. Wildcard characters * and ? are
	   permitted in the filespec operand.

	   All available memory is used. As many files as fit in memory
	   are sorted and displayed.

	   The /? refers to optional processing switches. You may use
	   one or more of the following:


Sort options:

	  /D   sort by file Date
	  /F   sort by File name
	  /N   no sorting of DIR entries
	  /S   sort by file Size
	  /X   sort by eXtension

File criteria:

	  /A   include Attributes, e.g. S=system, R=readonly, H=hidden
	  /H   include files with the Hidden attribute
	  /M   display only Modified files, i.e with Archive bit off
	  /P   include all Paths starting with the current directory

Display options:

	  /C   Clear screen first, and after any "... more" prompts
	  /W   Wait after screen full, ask for any key after 20 lines displayed
	  /?   display usage syntax

				    Examples
				    --------


	  o  Display all files, in filename order, on the current drive:

		LDIR


	  o  Display all files in the subdirectory \TEST\PGMS on drive B:

		LDIR B:\TEST\PGMS

	  o  Display only those files with an extension of .COM in the
	     current directory which is not a root directory:

		LDIR *.COM


	  o  Display all modified files in all subdirectories on current drive
	     and place the output in the file called DIRLIST on drive C:

		LDIR /M/P >C:DIRLIST

			       Changing defaults
			       -----------------

	The default option is to sort by file name. You may use DEBUG
	to permanently change this default. The bytes called FLAG1
	and FLAG2 contain the option indicators.

	Field	Offset	Option	Hex and bit values
	-----	------	------	-----------------------------------
	FLAG1	0111	  A	01  .... ...1
			  H	02  .... ..1.
			  C	04  .... .1..
			  D	08  .... 1...
			  X	10  ...1 ....
			  F	40  .1.. ....
			  S	80  1... ....

	FLAG2	0112	  M	01  .... ...1
			  W	02  .... ..1.
			  P	20  ..1. ....

	For example, to change to defaults to /A/P/D/F/W:
	FLAG1 becomes 01 + 08 + 40,  (A and D and F),
	FLAG2 becomes 02 + 20 = 22,  (W and P).

		DEBUG LDIR.COM
		-e 10d 49	     (should originally be 40)
		-e 10e 22	     (should originally be 00)
		-w
		-q

				Version History
				---------------

	   Version 2.3, August 10, 1985
		Correct some problems with path\filespec syntax
		Adds /M option to list modified files only

	   Version 2.4, October 28, 1985
		Adds /W option to pause after 20 lines are displayed
		Speeds up screen displays but defeats redirection

	   Version 2.5, November 5, 1985
		Minor changes for color displays

	   Version 2.6, January 4, 1986
		By popular demand, ability for redirection and
		use of PrtSc restored at the price of slower displays.
		Problem changing current directory fixed.

	   Version 2.7, February 15, 1986
		Minor corrections to command line syntax checking

	   Version 2.8, April 22, 1986
		A special request version that does NO sorting of
		the directory entries. The directory is displayed
		in its original order. This is now the /N option.

	   Version 2.9, May 12, 1986
		Corrects problem changing the current directory of
		the current drive when LDIR is used for a subdir on
		another drive.

	   Version 3.0, June 4, 1986
		Corrects a problem when DEBUG is used to change
		the default option switches. The attribute mask
		used to read directories was not being updated.

	   Version 3.1, Dec 28, 1986
	   Version 3.2, June 12, 1987
		Corrects problem specifying a filespec when in a
		subdirectory, e.g. LDIR *.ASM failed.

	   Version 4.1, Jan 25, 1989
		Expands the number of file names from 1000 to an amount
		determined by available memory. Approximately 64 bytes
		per file name is required. In other words, 64K bytes of
		memory is required for each 1000 files.

	   Version 4.3, Dec 14, 1989
		Change display of bytes used and free to allow values
		over 100 million; add commas. Also correct failure to
		clear the screen if the /C option is set by DEBUG.

	   Version 4.4, Mar 25, 1991
		Correct handling of /N no sort option when /A or /H
		is also specified.
