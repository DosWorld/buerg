FBR - File Backup / Restore                                             Page 1




                            Introduction
                            ------------

        FBR is a system of three small programs which perform the
        backing up and restoring of files.  They are similar to the
        DOS BACKUP/RESTORE utilities except that FBR can currently
        only process one directory at a time.  It does, however, back
        up all files in a directory, filling as many backup disks as
        necessary.  The FBR backup and restore programs can select
        files based upon 30 file specifications.



                             Programs
                             --------

        The FBR system consists of these files:

            FB.COM   -  used to back up files
            FR.COM   -  used to restore FBR files
            FS.COM   -  to report on contents of FBR files
            FBR.DOC  -  this document

        It is recommended that the FR.COM program be copied to the
        first diskette of each backup. This will insure that the
        restore program is the correct one for restoring the files.

                        Backup - FB Command
                        -------------------

        To back up files in a directory, use the FB.COM program.


    FB  [d:][\path][filespec] [filespec...] [/D] [/M] [/2] [/C] [/V] [t:]


        If no command line parameters are supplied, FB backs up
        all the files in the current directory to the disk in
        drive A.

        If the first d: operand is supplied, it specifies the drive,
        and/or path, and/or a file specification for the files to
        be backed up. Only files matching the 'filespec' are
        processed.

        More than one 'filespec' may be supplied. Separate each
        file specification by a blank or a comma.

        The IBMDOS.COM, IBMBIO.COM, MSDOS.SYS, and IO.SYS files are
        ignored.

        The last 't:' operand specifies the target drive, and it must
        be the LAST operand.

        The /D operand specifies that all files on the target
        disk be deleted before files are backed up to it.

        The /M operand specifies that only modified files are
        to be backed up, i.e. archive bit not set.

        The /2 operand specifies that the target drive is to
        alternate from either B to A, or from A to B. This allows
        backups to continue while changing floppy diskettes.

        The /C operand specifies that the archive bit for each
        file copied should be reset.

        The /V operand specifies that the DOS verify function should
        be used. This results in slower I/O but perhaps more peace
        of mind.

        As each file is processed, a message is displayed telling
        you the name of the file that has been copied. You may abort
        the back-up by pressing ESCape or control-C.

        When a backup drive fills, you are asked to ready another
        diskette and to press any key. To cancel the backup at this
        point, press the ESCape key.  The state of the copied files
        is unpredictable if you cancel the back up.

        Backup Examples:
        ---------------

        o  If the current drive is C: and the current directory
           is \ME, then to backup all of the C:\ME files
           onto two alternating drives, issue the following:

                FB /2    -or-  FB C:\ME\*.* /2  B:

        o  To backup only files with an extension of COM or EXE:

                FB *.COM *.EXE

                            Restore - FR Command
                            --------------------

        To restore files backed up by FB, use the FR.COM program.

|         FR  [d:][\path]  [filespec...]  [/2][/R][/U][/V]

        The 'd:' operand specifies the drive which contains the
        FBR files from FB. If omitted, drive A is used.

        The \path operand identifies the FBR file to use for the
        restore. If omitted, the first FBR file found is used.

        Up to 30 "filespec" parameters may be supplied. Only those
        files which match one of the "filespecs" are restored.

        The '/2' operand specifies that two drives are to be used
        for restoring files. The request for readying drives
        alternates from B to A, or from A to B.

|       The '/V' option specifies that the system verify option is
|       to be set on. Otherwise, verify is set off to improve speed.

|       The '/R' option specifies that any existing copies of the
|       files be over-written. If omitted, you will be asked whether
|       or not an existing file may be replaced.

|       The '/U' option specifies that only new files from the
|       backup set be restored. A new file is one that does not
|       already exist in the target directory, or one that has a
|       later file date and time.

        If you mount the wrong FBR disk, the program aborts. This
        will be corrected in a later version.

        As each file is restored, a message is displayed telling
        you the name of the file. As a backup disk becomes
        completely read, you are asked to ready another. You
        may press the ESCape or control-C at any time to cancel
        the restore operation. All files except the last one are valid.

        If the target disk runs out of space, the restore stops and
        the last file may be unusable.

|       Each restored file has the same or later date, and the same
|       file attribute as the original (backup copy) of the file.
|       Existing files are over-written if the /R option is used,
|       or if the backup copy of the file is newer and the /U option
|       is used.

        FR Examples:
        -----------

        o  To restore the files from an FBR disk(s) in
           drive B, use the following:

                FR B:


        o  Restore the subdirectory TEST which has an FBR file
           name of @TEST@@@.#01

                FR a:\test


        o  To restore only files with an extension of COM or EXE:
|          that are newer:

|               FR *.COM *.EXE /U

                            Status - FS Command
                            -------------------

        To determine the names of files backed up into FBR file(s),
        and on which diskette they reside, use the FS.COM program.

                FS  [d:][pathname]  [/N]

        The single operand 'd:' specifies the drive which contains
        the FBR file(s). If omitted, drive A is assumed.

        If no 'pathname' is supplied, the directories for all FBR
        files on the disk are displayed. Otherwise, only those
        FBR files which match the pathname are shown.

        It is not necessary to use the first disk of FBR files for
        FS to display file status information. The LAST diskette
        contains the most accurate data regarding which diskettes
        that files are on. If the 'Position' is given as '?', the
        diskette numbers are estimates.

        For each file backed up by FB, one line of information is
        displayed. This includes the file name, create date, file
        size, file attributes, and the diskette number. The files
        are displayed in alphabetical order unless the /N option
        is used, then the files are listed in the physical order
        in which they were backed up.

        If a file starts on one disk and ends on another, two volume
        numbers are displayed, e.g. 01 02.

        When the screen fills, the message "more..." is displayed.
        You may enter ESCape or control-C, or the letter N to abort
        and return to DOS.

                              Operational Notes
                              -----------------

        The FB backup program creates one file on each disk that it uses.

        The filename is of the form '@ppppppp.#nn',

             where 'nn' is a sequential volume number beginning with 01;
             and 'ppppppp' is the name of the origin directory. For root
             directories, the name also contains the drive letter.
             For example, '@ROOTC@@.#01' is the first backup file for
             the root directory of the disk from drive C.

        FB  may not scratch the target disk. It will use whatever space
        is available for making its backup copies and ask for another
        disk as needed. Because the FBR filenames are taken from the
        the origin directory name, more than directory may be backed up
        onto one diskette.

        FB requires about 64K of memory but will use all available
        memory if it needs to for storing directory information.

        FR restores files to the current drive and subdirectory. This
        is intentional as it yields more flexibility.

        I've noticed that FBR is about twice as fast as BACKUP, and
        that the /2 option for using two drives is very helpful. The
        amount of disk space is about the same.

        The FBR files may reside on any type of disk supported by the
        operating system. That is, a floppy diskette may be backed up
        to a fixed disk, if so desired.

        Since the FBR files are unique on any disk (or subdirectory)
        there is no reason why they can not be sQueezed or ARCed for
        transporting to other systems. For example, an entire floppy
        disk of files will most likely produce one FBR file that can
        be compressed and then transmitted.


                             More?
                             -----

        FBR was written to satisfy my personal method of backup. I'm
        sure there are much better methods and programs, but FBR is
        cheap (free), and it's easy for me to use. I don't use it for
        all my backup procedures, but it has saved me more than once.

        Future enhancements will allow processing all subdirectories
        in the current directory, formatting of the target disks, and
        the ability to add files to an existing FBR file.

        If you like FBR, let me know. Otherwise I'll get bored with
        it and forget all about it.

                             Version History
                             ---------------

        1.0 - October 28, 1985

        1.1 - October 30, 1985
                - added /C and /V options to FB
                - subdirectory and IBMxxx.COM entries are excluded
                  from the FBR files to save some space
                - fixed the ESCape (or ctrl-C) response to abort FB
                - changed FS to show two disk numbers for files which
                  span volumes

        1.2 - October 31, 1985

        1.3 - November 12, 1985
                - the table at the beginning of each FBR file now contains
                  the actual diskette number for each file, this makes
                  this version incompatibile with previous versions, so
                  it's a good idea to place FR.COM on each FBR disk.
                - FS now lists the file alphabetically, and if the last
                  disk is used, the diskette numbers are accurate; otherwise
                  the diskette number is calculated and may not be correct.
                - the FBR file name was changed to allow multiple directories
                  to be backed up onto one disk; this also provides more
                  information about what the FBR file contains.
                - the ESCape key can be used at any time during FB to abort
                  the backup.

        1.4 - December 7, 1985
                - FB may selectively back up files
                - FR may selectively restore files
                - FS processes all FBR files on the specified drive
                - the ESCape and control-C keys may be used at any
                  time to abort an FBR program; control-break is not
                  accepted

        1.45 - January 25, 1986
                - correct path syntax for FR

        1.47 - February 2, 1986
                - corrections to FR for multiple volumes

        1.49 - February 16, 1986
                - corrections to FR for large files spanning two disks
                - add path operand to FS
                - remove BIOS specific display routines from FS

        1.50 - March 13, 1986
                - corrections to FR for selective file restore
                - add display options to FS

        1.53 - May 21, 1986
                - add /D option to FB to delete files on target disks
                - exclude MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS
                - change FB to process files in ascending size order

        1.54 - June 14, 1986
|               - add /V, /R and /U options to FR
|               - display file names 5-up in FR
|               - make FB smaller
