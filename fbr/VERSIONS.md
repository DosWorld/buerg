  - the table at the beginning of each FBR file now contains the actual diskette number for each file, this makes this version incompatibile with previous versions, so it's a good idea to place FR.COM on each FBR disk.
  - FS now lists the file alphabetically, and if the last disk is used, the diskette numbers are accurate; otherwise the diskette number is calculated and may not be correct.
  - the FBR file name was changed to allow multiple directories to be backed up onto one disk; this also provides more information about what the FBR file contains.
