DIRAGE                                                          Version 1.24
------                                                          Sep 10, 1988




        DIRAGE is a tool for PCBoard sysops for determining which files
        have not been downloaded for a specified period of time. With
        this knowledge, the sysop can delete old and unpopular files to
        make room for new files.


        DIRAGE requires two input files. The first is the PCBoard DIRnn
        files, where nn is a number from 1 to 99. These are the listings
        of files available for downloading. You will need to run DIRAGE
        once for each conference since each will have its own subdirectory
        of DIRnn files.


        The second input file is a history file of download activity.
        It is created by combining all DOWNLOAD.TXT files for the
        longest period of time that you wish to analyze.  For example,
        if you wish to purge files which have not been downloaded for
        six months, copy all of the DOWNLOAD.TXT files for the past six
        months to a single file.  You can call this new file whatever
        you like.


        DIRAGE creates one or two output files.  The first is a listing
        of all DIRnn files, in alphabetical order, that have not been
        downloaded for a specified number of days.  The second file is
        optional and is called DELAGED.BAT. It is created only if the
        /B parameter is supplied on the command line.  It is a batch
        file which contains one line for each of the listed old files.
        With it, you can delete the old files, move them to a safe
        place, or whatever you like.  You will have to edit the batch
        file to change drives, paths, and the DOS command.


        DIRAGE is limited to a total of 3300 DIRnn entries. If you have
        more files than that, you will have to split up your DIRnn files
        and run DIRAGE for each set of them.


        DIRAGE was written in Quick Basic Version 3 using some assembler
        subroutines and an old ADVBAS library from Tom Hanlin; by
        Vernon D. Buerg.

                        Example
                        -------

        - All of the DIRnn files were copied to F:\DIRAGE
        - All of the DOWNLOAD.TXT files for the last six months
          were copied to MBDL.TXT. If COPY hoses up, use the TABS
          program with /D to get rid of the extra EOF and blank
          characters. If you don't have DOWNLOAD.TXT file from PCBoard
          version 12.1 or later, try using the program P2PDLTXT to
          create them from CALLERS files.
