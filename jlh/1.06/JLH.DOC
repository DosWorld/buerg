JLH Command
-----------

Function:  To invoke TallTree's JET utility to copy files from
	   every directory on a drive to another drive.

Usage:	   JLH	s:[\path]  t:  [options]

Remarks:   The s: parameter specifies the source drive. The t: parameter
	 specifies the target drive and defaults to drive A.

	   The 'path' operand is optional. If omitted, all directories
	 on the source drive, beginning with the root directory, are
	 copied to the target drive. If 'path' is supplied, directories
	 beginning with the specified path are copied.

	   The 'options' are passed to the JET utility. None are
	 required.

Examples:

	o  Copy all from all directories on drive C to floppy drive A,
	   on to as many diskettes as needed:

		JLH  C: A: /D

	o  Restore all files from the diskettes in drive A: to drive C:
	   for the subdirectory called TEST

		JLH  A:\TEST C: /R

	o  Copy all files in all subdirectories from drive C to drive D
	   with the mandatory option:

		JLH  C: D: /M
