---------------------------------                                  Jan  3, 1991

  Usage:
  -----

        CS analyzes a PCBoard caller's log file and produces a report
        of system and user activity.  The command line syntax is:

   CS callerfile [outfilename]  [/N] [/V] [/1] [/SU] [/FF] [/C:n] [/T] [/U]
                                [/S:mmddyy] [/E:mmddyy]

        where:
           'callerfile' is the name of a log file. It may be the combination
                        of several actual caller files, but the utilization
                        figures will be inaccurate.

           'outfilename' is the name of a file to receive the report; the
                        default is to display all reports

           /N           specifies to suppress pause at screen end
           /V           specifies to check records for validity against the
                        PCBTEXT file; this is may not be valid for later
                        versions of PCBoard
           /1           includes files in the downloads report for files
                        downloaded only once, otherwise only files downloaded
                        twice or more are reported
           /SU          suppresses the  "User Activity" report
           /S:mmddyy    starting date to process log records
           /E:mmddyy    ending date to process log records
           /FF          specifies that form feeds are generated for
                        each report page
           /C:n         specifies a single node number
           /T           records unprocessed or unknown records in the
                        file called PCBCS.UNK
           /U           write the user statistics report to file called USTATS
