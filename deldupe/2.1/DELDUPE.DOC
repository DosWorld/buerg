Purpose:
	Delete duplicate or older files in one directory that already
	exist in another disk directory.

Syntax:
	DELDUPE directory-to-delete [master-directory] [/O] [/T] [/S] [/V] [/P]

	The 'directory-to-delete' specifies the drive and path name
	of the 'old' directory containing old or duplicate files.

	The 'master-directory' specifies the drive and path name
	of the 'new' directory containing current or original files.
|	If omitted, the current drive and directory is used.

	If files in the 'old' directory are the same date/time, or older,
	than files of the same name in the 'new' directory, they are
	deleted.

	Specify /O to delete older files of same name but of different size.
	If omitted, only files with the same name, datestamp, and size will
	be deleted.

	Specify /S to delete similar files. A similar file has the same
	date but the time and/or size is different.

	Specify /T to display filenames only, but do not delete them. Use
	this option to determine which files are duplicates or older copies.

	Specify /V to confirm deletion of each eligible file.

|	Specify /P to pause when the screen fills. You may enter a ^C (break)
|	at this point but the current directory will not be properly restored.

Examples:
	- Delete duplicate files in 'C:\TEMP' which already exist
	  in the root directory of drive B:

	  deldupe c:\temp b:

	- Display the names of duplicate or older files in the directory
	  called \PROJECTS which already exist in the directory \TEST

	  deldupe \projects \test /o/t
