Purpose:
        Delete duplicate or older files in one directory that already
        exist in another disk directory.

Syntax:
        DELDUPE  directory-to-delete  [master-directory]
                 [/O] [/T] [/S] [/V] [/P] [/N]

        The 'directory-to-delete' specifies the drive and path name of
        the 'old' directory containing old or duplicate files.

        The 'master-directory' specifies the drive and path name of the
        'new' directory containing current or original files.  If
        omitted, the current drive and directory is used.

        If files in the 'old' directory are the same date/time, or
        older, than files of the same name in the 'new' directory, they
        are deleted.

        Specify /O to delete older files:  same name but of different
        size.  If omitted, only files with the same name, datestamp, and
        size will be deleted.

        Specify /S to delete similar files:  the same name and date/time
        but the size is different.

|       Specify /N to delete files of the same name regardless of the
|       date, time, or file size.

        Specify /T to display filenames only, but do not delete them.
        Use this option to determine which files are duplicates or older
        copies.

        Specify /V to confirm deletion of each eligible file.

        Specify /P to pause when the screen fills.  You may enter a ^C
        (break) at this point but the current directory will not be
        properly restored.

Examples:
        - Delete duplicate files in 'C:\TEMP' which already exist
          in the root directory of drive B:

          deldupe c:\temp b:

        - Display the names of duplicate or older files in the directory
          called \PROJECTS which already exist in the directory \TEST

          deldupe \projects \test /o/t

        Version 1.1, 3/07/87 - initial version
|       Version 2.2, 7/21/87 - added /N to delete files of same name
