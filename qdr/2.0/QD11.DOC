 Command QDR                                            Version 2.0
 -----------                                            Oct 17, 1986


 Purpose
 -------
        Re-format a floppy disk quickly, optionally with a new
        volume label, deleting all files and sub-directories.

 Format
 ------
                QDR [d:][label]  [/F][/1][/3][/4][/8] [/N]

 Remarks
 -------
        The  d:  parameter supplies the drive letter, A to K.  If no
        drive letter is supplied,  A is used.  A fixed disk  can not
        be formatted.

        You may supply a volume label (up to 11 characters) immediately
        following the drive letter.  For example:

                QDR b:scratch

        The /N option suppresses the "press ENTER to continue" prompt.

        The DOS error level is set to 0 for successful completion, or to
        1 if any errors occur.


Formatting
----------
        Use the /F option to force a full format of all tracks.

        You may suppy /1 to force SSSD format, /4 for DSQD (1.2mb), or
        /3 for DSQD (720kb), or /8 for eight-sectors (SSSD or DSDD).

        It is recommended that you use DOS FORMAT since QDR is not much
        faster when doing a full format and does not mark bad
        clusters.

        Unless /F is used, the diskette must have been previously
        formatted.  The allowable diskette formats are:  DSQD (1.2mb or
        720kb), SSSD/8, SSSD/9, DSDD/8, and DSDD/9.  When information is
        available for other drive types, they will be added to the data
        in the internal device table.  Your system hardware and software
        must support the device type.
