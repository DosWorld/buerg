 Command QDR						Version 2.2
 -----------						Oct 21, 1986


 Purpose
 -------
	Re-format a floppy disk quickly, optionally with a new
	volume label, deleting all files and sub-directories.

 Format
 ------
		QDR [d:][label]  [/F][/1][/3][/4][/8] [/N]

 Remarks
 -------
	The d:	parameter supplies the drive letter, A to K.  If no
	drive letter is supplied, A is used.  A fixed disk can not be
	re-formatted.

	You may supply a volume label (up to 11 characters) immediately
	following the drive letter.  For example:

		QDR b:scratch

	The /N option suppresses the "press ENTER to continue" prompt.
	Otherwise, press the enter key to reformat the disk, or the
	ESCape key to cancel.

	Use the /F option to force a full format of all tracks.  The /1,
	/3, /4, and /8 options apply to a full format.

	Bad clusters remain marked as bad unless a full format is used,
	then clusters are marked as unusable if they can not be formatted.

	The DOS error level is set to 0 for successful completion, or to
	1 if any errors occur.


 Formatting
 ----------
	To perform a full format of a disk sectors, use the /F options.
	It is recommended that you use DOS FORMAT since QDR is not much
	faster when doing a full format. Both mark bad clusters.

	You may suppy /1 to force SSSD format, /4 for DSQD (1.2mb), or
	/3 for DSQD (720kb), or /8 for eight-sectors (SSSD or DSDD).

	Unless /F is used, the diskette must have been previously
	formatted.  The allowable diskette formats are:  DSQD (1.2mb or
	720kb), SSSD/8, SSSD/9, DSDD/8, and DSDD/9.  When information is
	available for other drive types, they will be added to the data
	in the internal device table.  Your system hardware and software
	must support the device type.
