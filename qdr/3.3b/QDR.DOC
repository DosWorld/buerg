 -----------                                                Dec 28, 1987
 
 
 Purpose
 -------
        Prepare a floppy diskette  for re-use by formatting  it quickly,
        optionally with a new volume label.
 
 Format
 ------
                QDR [d:][label]  [/F] [/N] [/V] [/B] [/Q]
                                 [/1] [/2] [/3] [/4] [/8]
 
 Remarks
 -------
        The d: parameter is required and it  supplies  the drive letter.
        A fixed disk  can not  be re-formatted.
 
        You may supply a volume label (up to 11 characters)  immediately
        following the drive letter.  For example:
 
                QDR b:scratch
 
        You may  supply the  /F option  to force  a full  format of  all
        tracks.  The  /1, /2,  /3, /4,  and /8  options apply  to a full
        format, and specify the disk type.
 
        Bad clusters remain marked as bad unless a full format is  used,
        then  clusters  are  marked  as  unusable  if  they  can  not be
        formatted.  Use the /V (verbose) option to receive a display  of
        the cluster numbers that are marked as not usable.
 
        The /N option suppresses  the "press ENTER to  continue" prompt.
        Otherwise, press  the enter  key to  reformat the  disk, or  the
        ESCape key to cancel.
 
        The DOS error level is set to 0 for successful completion, or to
        1 if any errors occur.

 Command QDR                                                Version 3.3b
 -----------                                                Dec 28, 1987
 
                        Options
                        -------
 
        /F - forced full format; uses DOS to format and verify each
             track.
 
        /1 - forces single  sided format,  SSSD/8 or  SSSD/9, on 360 kb
             drives when /F is used.
 
        /2 - forces DSHD format on 1440 kb capacity drives
 
        /3 - forces DSQD format on 720 kb capacity drives
 
        /4 - forces DSDD format on 1.2 mb capacity drives
 
        /8 - forces 8-sector format; SSSD/8 or DSDD/8, on 360 kb drives
 
        /N - no prompt; skips the "Press ENTER" message and reply
 
        /V - verbose messages; displays a message for each cluster  that
             is marked as unusable
 
        /B - use disk BIOS routines only for formatting; if omitted, the
             DOS  routines  used  for  formatting  are determined by the
             version  of  DOS  in  use.   This  option is supplied as an
             alternative to the default because  QDR may not be able  to
             format  a  new  diskette  when  certain  device  drivers or
             versions of DOS are installed.
 
        /Q - quick format without verification or bad track marking.  If
             the target  disk has  bad spots,  write errors  may result.
             This  option   is  NOT   recommended  for   formatting  new
             diskettes.
 
 
 
                         Formatting
                         ----------
 
        To perform a full format of a disk sectors, use the /F  options.
        It is recommended that you use DOS FORMAT since QDR is not  much
        faster when doing a full format.  Both mark bad clusters.
 
|       You may suppy /1 to force SSSD format, /4 for DSDD (360k), or /3
        for DSQD (720kb), or /8 for eight-sectors (SSSD or DSDD).
 
 
        Unless  /F  is  used,  the  diskette  must  have been previously
        formatted.  The allowable diskette  formats are: DSQD (1.2mb  or
        720kb),  SSSD/8,  SSSD/9,  DSDD/8,  DSDD/9,  and DSHD (1.44 mb).
 
        When information is available  for other drive types,  they will
        be added to the data in the internal device table.  Your  system
        hardware and software must support the device type.

                         Examples
                         --------
 
     o  Reformat a previously formatted and used diskette. Write a
        volume label of SCRATCH:
 
                QDR A:scratch
 
     o  Alternately format new diskettes in drives A and B.
        First, create a BAT file called TWOFOR.BAT with these commands:
 
                QDR A: /F/N
                QDR B: /F/N
                TWOFOR
 
        Then, issue the command TWOFOR.  When the last diskette has been
        formatted, press ctrl-C to abort the program.
 
 
     o  Fully format a disk quickly using BIOS routines; suppress the
        "Press ENTER" prompt:
 
                QDR A: /fnbq
