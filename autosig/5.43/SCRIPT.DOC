-------------------------                                   Nov 19, 1987


        ATO can  execute commands  from a  script file.   Scripts are  a
        series of user  coded statements contained  within a file.   You
        execute a script by issuing the alt-T command while in  Terminal
        Mode.  Or, you may specify  a special logon script in  each Host
        entry.


        A script ends when the last statement has been processed, or you
        press the ESCape key, or if an error is detected.


        You may also enter one  script command at the terminal  by using
        the alt-I keys.


        Script statements have the following syntax:

                verb  [operand1 operand2 ... operandn]

        You must separate the verb  and operands by one or  more blanks.
        The verbs are:

        SEND, WAIT,  PAUSE, LABEL,  GOTO, IF,  SET, EXIT,  DISPLAY, BEEP
        TRACE,  ACCEPT,  CLS,  *,  THEN,  ELSE, DOW, UPL, LOGOFF, AUTO1,
        AUTO2


        Operands consist  of one  or more  symbol names,  and/or literal
        data.   Symbols  are  either  global  system  variables, or user
        defined  variables.   The  names  may  be  of any length and may
        contain any characters except a space or a single quote.  Global
        names are listed later.  User names can be any name except  that
        of a  global varable.   Literal data  is a  string of characters
        enclosed within single quotes.  Quotes are note required  unless
        the literal string contains the name of a symbol.


        For example, HOST.NAME is a  global variable, XYZ may be  a user
        variable, and 'hello' is literal data.


        If the operand is [data], you may supply a list of symbol  names
        and/or literal values.  They are combined into one value.


        While scripts  are being  processed, COM  data may  be received.
        The COM  data is  not processed  until a  READ or  WAIT verb  is
        executed.  The last line of COM data is available in the  global
        variable called %COM.

                        Statement syntax
                        ----------------

  Verb:     * [comment]
  Function: Provide user comments or remarks
  Usage:    The statement is ignored.

  Verb:     READ  [symbol]
  Function: Get data from the COM port and place it into the COM buffer,
            and into any supplied symbol name.

  Verb:     SEND  [data]
  Function: Write data to the COM port
  Usage:    The data may be a list of symbol names and literal strings.
            All data fields are combined into one string and sent to the
            COM port. Control characters may be entered by using the carat
            symbol (^) followed by a control character letter. For example,
            a ^M will result in a carriage return (CR) being sent. A pause
            may be embedded in any data string by entering a squiggle (~)
            character.


  Verb:     WAIT  [data]
  Function: Suspend processing until the data is received from the COM
            port.
  Usage:    Checking is performed for lost carrier and the modem return
            messages for NO CARRIER, etc. If a disconnect if detected,
            the script is terminated.


  Verb:     PAUSE [number]
  Function: Suspend processing for 'number' of seconds.
  Usage:    If the 'number' is omitted, a one second pause results.


  Verb:     LABEL labelname
  Function: Identify a statement for branching purposes.
  Usage:    There is no checking for duplicate labels. The first occurence
            of the label name is used by script verbs, e.g. GOTO.


  Verb:     GOTO labelname
  Function: Transfer script processing to the LABEL statement with the
            identity of 'labelname'.


  Verb:     SET symbol data
  Function: Assign a value to a symbol.
  Usage:    Unless noted below, values can not be assigned to global
            symbols. User symbols become defined when they are referenced
            by a SET statement. The 'data' may be a list of symbol names
            and/or literal data. For example,
                SET x 'hello'
                SET y x
                results in the symbol y having the value 'hello'.

                        ----------------

  Verb:     EXIT
  Function: Terminate processing of the current script file.

  Verb:     DISPLAY [data]
  Function: Writes data to the current display monitor.
  Usage:    The 'data' value may be a list of symbol names, and/or literal
            strings.

  Verb:     BEEP
  Function: Sound the computer's bell.

  Verb:     TRACE [ON|OFF]
  Function: Enable or disable tracing of the script statements. If TRACE
            is ON, all script statements are displayed before they  are
            executed.

  Verb:     ACCEPT symbol
  Function: Read data from the console into a variable.
  Usage:    If 'symbol' is not currently defined, it becomes defined.
            Unless otherwise noted, global symbols may not be modified.

  Verb:     CLS
  Function: Clear the screen.


  Verb:     IF var1 var2 [statement]
  Function: Set the condition code based on contents of 'var1' and 'var2'
  Usage:    The condition is set to TRUE if 'var2' occurs withing the
            'var1' variable. The optional [statement] is executed when
            the condition is true.


  Verb:     THEN [statement]
  Function: Process statements when the condition is true.

  Verb:     ELSE [statement]
  Function: Process statements when the condition is false.


  Verb:     DOW filename
  Function: Invokes CIS B protocol to download the specified file. The
            file is placed in the drive\path defined by the Host entry.


  Verb:     UPL filename
  Function: Invokes CIS B protocol to upload the specified file. The file
            must be in the drive\path defined by the Host entry.


  Verb:     LOGOFF -or- OFF
  Function: Performs the Z (logoff) function by sending an OFF to CIS
            and then hanging up the phone.

-------------------------                                   Nov 19, 1987

                        Examples
                        --------

  o  Demonstrate the use of IF, THEN, and ELSE

          read
        label again
          if %COM 'Function:' then display 'not yet'
           else display 'not yet'
          goto again
        label ready
           beep
           display 'What time is it?'
           accept tod
           exit

        The 'IF' verb does not require a statement.  You can place
    any valid statment after the  IF, and/or can use the  THEN and
    ELSE verbs later.   The IF condition  remains valid until  the
    next IF is executed.

  o  Demonstrate the use of SEND, WAIT, and literal strings.

        trace on
        Send 'go ' ibmcom^M
        Wait Function:
        Send 'ust^M'
       label loop
        If 'Function:' Goto Ready
        Read
        Goto loop
       label ready
        display Ready to proceed...
        beep

  o Demonstrate use of global variables

         * Use the current HOST and SIG selections to log on
         send ATDT %HOSTPHONE ^M
         wait CONNECT
         pause 4
         send '^C'
         wait User ID:
         display '{' %COM '}'
         send %HOSTUSERID ^M
         wait Password:
         send %HOSTPASSWORD '^M'
         wait OK
         send 'GO ' %SIGPAGE
         wait 'Function:'
         set savecolor %PCNORMAL
         set %PCNORMAL '15,2'
         display 'The current high message number is:' %SIGHMN
         set %PCNORMAL savecolor
         beep
         display 'Ready when you are ...'
