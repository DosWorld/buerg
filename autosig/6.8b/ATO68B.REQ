        AUTOSIG (ATO) is the original PC program written for the PC and
        Compuserve.  It not only automates forums functions, including
        the automation of downloading files, it also has the ability to
        run scripts.  Scripts make ATO useful in all CompuServe areas.

        ATO is free.  There are no charges or other restrictive
        requirements (though we do ask that you enjoy it!).  All you
        need to do is download the files, make several adjustments in
        your forum options, and you're ready to enjoy the benefits of
        CompuServe without the price of on-line interactive sessions.
        Autosig makes the best of both worlds:  the benefits of
        multiuser mainframes and the benefits of a personal computer.


                     * * *   HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS   * * *

        In general AUTOSIG (ATO) version 6.8B requires the following
        equipment configuration:

         o  an IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 or close compatible.
         o  at least 320K of available memory.
         o  a hard disk is recommended, but not required.
         o  a Hayes command set compatible modem
         o  any display adapter and monitor

   -    ATO has been tested on the Compaq portable, Tandy machines,
        Toshiba laptops, the Leading Edge, the Compaq high-end machines,
        the AST Premium line, and a number of compatibles too numerous
        to mention.  All close compatibles will probably work, but be
        sure to check the user's manual for various "switches" that
        might be necessary.

        ATO is network, e.g. LANTASTIC, compatible, although it does not
        allow the sharing of its files with the exception of Novell Netware.

        ATO is NOT compatible with Novell Netware. You will need to run
        ATO without Netware loaded.

        About 320k of *free* memory is required.  More than 320k is
        definitely better. The total amount of
        memory is somewhat dependent upon how many forums you use, the
        number of message headers you want to mark, and some other
        factors.

   -    ATO requires at least 250K of disk space for its files. More
        disk space is needed to hold message files and other files that
        are to be downloaded.  A hard disk is not required, but it is
        highly recommended.

   -    A modem capable of autodialing is required.  If you're not
        using a Hayes command set compatible modem, you'll need to be
        familar with your modem's command codes in order to set it up.

        There is built-in support for accessing CompuServe through a
        direct node and through Telenet and Tymnet.  Using ATO's script
        language, you will be able to log on through virtually any
        network, but it may require work on your part in determining
        the correct sequence of prompts and responses.

   -    ATO supports MS and Logitech compatible mouse input devices.

   -    ATO supports MDA, Hercules, CGA, EGA, and VGA displays. 25, 43,
        and 50-line displays are supported for those display adapters
        that offer such modes. Graphics is not used or required.


                     * * *   SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS   * * *

        In general, ATO requires the following software configuration:

         o  IBM PC DOS or MS DOS version 3.0 or later
         o  no ill-behaved resident (TSR) programs
         o  the AUTOSIG.EXE program

        DOS 3.0 or greater is recommended.  ATO will run fine on DOS 2.x
        systems, but you may experience problems with the "Shell to DOS
        feature" of ATO.  This is an incompatibility with the compiler
        used to create the ATO executable program file and DOS 2.x.

        ATO is DesqView and DoubleDOS aware.  It is also compatible with
        many popular resident programs, but you may have certain memory
        resident utilities installed that can cause problems.

        ATO is compatible with RAM disks (like VDISK), disk caching
        programs (like VCACHE), keyboard enhancers (like PCED), screen
        enhancers (like Ultra Vision), print spoolers (like LTORQ and
        PCACHE).

        If you have a problem, PLEASE let us know in section 1 of
        IBMCOM.  We can usually work it out but, if not, we need to know
        of possible incompatibilities.  ATO is a group effort and we
        appreciate and encourage hearing about your problems, solutions
        and suggestions.


                          * * *   FILES NEEDED   * * *

        All AUTOSIG files are located in Library 1 (Autosig) of the IBM
        Communications forum (GO IBMCOM).

        At minimum, you'll want to get ATO68B.EXE, which contains the
        executable file and the help file, and ATODOC.EXE which contains
        the documentation file.  These will get you going.  Both are
        self-extracting archives.  When you run them, they tell you what
        to do to install the files.

        Otherwise ATO is "modular" in design, so you don't have to
        download what you don't want or need.  However, you may find
        that other programs, such as ACLS, ATOBRO, ATOADV, and
        DLSCAN, will greatly enhance your use of ATO.  Please note that
        the latter files are entirely optional!
