    WHAT IS AUTOSIG?
    ----------------

    AUTOSIG is a free communications program which was specifically
    designed to make it easy for you to use CompuServe, and particularly
    its forums and your CompuServe Mail.  Forums are electronic
    gatherings where people of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) can
    exchange information, ideas, and files of programs and data.


    ----------------------
    WHAT CAN IT DO FOR ME?
    ----------------------

    AUTOSIG (sometimes known as ATO for short) provides you with an
    automatic way of processing forum and mail messages that is very
    quick and extremely economical.  You can use AUTOSIG to upload
    and download program and data files to CompuServe, and as a terminal
    emulator for CompuServe's other services.

    The key to the speed is AUTOSIG's "grouping" (or batching) of
    messages in all of your forums (and your replies to them) for
    transmission to and from CompuServe.  You spend all the time you
    want thinking about what people have said to you, and about what
    you want to say back.  When you are finished, AUTOSIG does the
    rest quickly and efficiently!

    The key to the economy is AUTOSIG's frugal use of online connection
    time.  We've fine-tuned this science/art to the point where your
    connection time to CompuServe will be the absolute minimum necessary
    to get the job done.  You may find your bills drop by ten times what
    you pay if you use the system through the manual menus.  (Or you may
    find that your bills don't drop at all, and that you get ten times
    the productivity out of CompuServe!)


    -------------
    CAN I USE IT?
    -------------

    AUTOSIG has certain hardware, software, and network requirements.
    These are outlined in detail in the file ATO63A.REQ, but here's a
    summary of them.

       HARDWARE

             o  an IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 (not the 50Z) or close compatible.
             o  at least 256K and more often 320K of available memory.
             o  a hard disk is recommended for speed, but is not required.
                -  a minimum of 250K of disk space is needed
             o  a Hayes command set compatible modem
                -  autodial-capable
             o  optional mouse (MS and Logitech compatible are supported)
             o  display adapter and monitor
                -  graphics are not required or used

       SOFTWARE

             o  DOS 3.0 or later is recommended.  DOS 2.x will work
                but may cause problems.
             o  DESQview and Double DOS environments are supported.

       NETWORK ACCESS

             o  CompuServe direct access, Telenet or Tymnet (built in)
         or  o  you write your own script for all others. Full script
                language is supported.

    --------------------
    WHERE CAN I FIND IT?
    --------------------

    All AUTOSIG files are located in AutoSig Library (Lib 1) of the IBM
    Communications forum (GO IBMCOM at any ! prompt).  Here's what you'll
    need:

       ----------------
       BEFORE YOU START
       ----------------

       ATO68B.REQ  - A complete description of the hardware and software
                     requirements.  Download and read this before going
                     further.  (An ASCII file.)

       ----------------
       GETTING STARTED
       ----------------

       ATO68B.EXE  - The executable program itself and a script (an
                     automation tool) for setting your forum parameters
                     to get started.  (A self-extracting archive.)

       ATODOC.EXE  - The user's manual.  Everything you want to know
                     about the program.  (A self-extracting archive.)

       ----------------
       ADVANCED USES
       ----------------

       ACL313.EXE - A program which allows you to find out how much
                    you are spending while you are using AUTOSIG.

       ATOBRO.EXE - A program which allows you to create scripts for
                    downloading files from the Libraries (Libs).
                    (A Self extracting archive).


       ATOADV.EXE - A manual which documents AUTOSIG's advanced functions.
                    (A self-extracting archive.)

       DLSCAN.ARC - A program which builds a catalog of files in the
                    CompuServe Libraries of your choice, and
                    automatically downloads the ones you pick (through Autosig)


    --------------------
    HOW DO I INSTALL IT?
    --------------------

    AUTOSIG is simple to install.  Follow these steps:

             o  Download files ATO68B.EXE and ATODOC.EXE.  A separate
                subdirectory is strongly recommended.

             o  At the DOS prompt in the subdirectory you've chosen,
                type ATO68 to extract the program.

             o  Back at the DOS prompt again, type ATODOC to extract
                the users manual.

             o  Read the first portion of the users manual (you'll
                find it in file AUTOSIG.DOC from the extraction),
                follow the steps outlined there and your on your way!


    -----------------
