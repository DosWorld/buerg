     Preface 
______________________________________________________________________________

    AUTOSIG is a communications program written specifically for  CompuServe 
    Special Interest Group use.  It provides an automatic way of  processing 
    SIG messages  that is  quick and  economical.  Written  in BASIC,  it is 
    provided as a compiled QuickBasic, executable (.EXE) program for the IBM 
    PC. ATO is  fully compatible with  Compaq computers, the  Tandy 1000 and 
    1200,  and  most  other  clones.   In  addition  to  its main purpose of 
    offloading  messages,  it  is  a  terminal  program which can be used to 
    access other areas  of CompuServe and  download from the  Data Libraries 
    using the CompuServe Quick "B" protocol. 
 
 
                A word or two about the Deeper Meanings of ATO. 
                _______________________________________________ 
 
    Ah ha,  my chance  for a  fireside chat.   Don't worry,  I'll try not to 
    ramble for too long but ATO holds a very special place on my hard disk. 
 
    ATO celebrates its 4 birthday and fifth public release which is  nothing 
    short of  incredible when  you think  about the  features that have been 
    carefully  crafted  since  it  started  out.   The amount of work by its 
    contributors is nothing short of awe inspiring.  Why? 
 
    ATO is to my  thinking a community hack  in the true sense  of the word, 
    that is, lots of people contributing time and effort just for the  sheer 
    joy of programming and throwing their modems on the line for testing. 
 
    Why is this inspiring?   Since day one ATO  has been free with  the only 
    motive of the authors is that you enjoy it. 
 
    This version represent  some truly outstanding  work by Jim  McKeown.  A 
    special thanks to him from  me for his work on  the editor as it is  far 
    beyond what I was able to accomplish. 
 
    Vern Buerg continues  to add, optimize  and amaze with  the most obvious 
    additions of a script language and new, fast B protocol.  What's  hidden 
    is his translation of  many of the routines  into assembler.  I know  of 
    only a portion of the time he  spent working on them and that alone,  is 
    impressive.  Certainly the total time  represents a large number of  all 
    night  coding  and  debugging  sessions.   I  consider  it  a very large 
    pleasure knowing  Vern.  He  is truly  an example  of what the computing 
    fraternity is  all about  and is  so modest  and low  key I know this is 
    embarrassing to him.  Be that  as it may I know  that I've got a lot  of 
    his programs in my survival kit.  Sorry Vern, but at least take one bow. 
 
    ATO makes no claims at to  being 1) the best all purpose  communications 
    program in the world, 2) the most flexible or 3) the fastest.  No  doubt 
    there  will  always  be  raging  debates  over the "best" communications 
    program.  ATO makes no such claims.  ATO DOES represent a lot of work by 
    a lot of people  that expect nothing in  return, beyond hoping that  you 
    enjoy the fruit of their efforts.  Isn't that nice?

I.   Introduction 
______________________________________________________________________________

    AUTOSIG, or ATO  for short, is  a communications program  that automates 
    access to  Compuserve (CIS)  and specifically  to its  Forum (or Special 
    Interest  Group,  or  SIG)   message  boards  and  to   electronic  mail 
    (EasyPlex).  The program allows users to select which messages they want 
    to read,  download them,  sign off  CIS, read  the messages  and compose 
    replies or new messages using AUTOSIG's own text editor, then go  online 
    again to  upload what  they have  written.  ATO  can also  be used as an 
    ordinary terminal  program to  access any  page of  CIS or the Executive 
    Option,  to  capture  text  files,  and  to download files from SIG Data 
    Libraries or Access using  Compuserve's "B" protocol including  the new, 
    fast, Quick B flavor. 
 
    In designing AUTOSIG, the authors have set both flexibility and ease  of 
    use  as  their  goals.   Therefore  the  program  is  menu  rather  than 
    command-driven:  there  is  no  need  to  memorize AUTOSIG's options and 
    commands.  We  have chosen  to offer  help in  this documentation rather 
    than onscreen (excepting the new editor), so that explanations can be as 
    long as they need to be.   ATO users who have questions not  answered in 
    the  documentation  should  ask  them  in  the  IBM  Communications  SIG 
    (IBMCOM),  where  the  authors  or  other  experienced users will try to 
    answer them. 
 
    Don't be daunted by the size of the manual.  Effectively this manual  is 
    one for a  communications program, a  database, a macro  language and an 
    editor.  Given  that it's  pretty small  so hang  in there.   There is a 
    strong human tendency to avoid unpleasant, time consuming tasks, and for 
    many of us, the reading of an entire manual is one of them.  Many  folks 
    have asked the  question "I just  wanna do it!   Why not leave  the hard 
    stuff  until  later?"   That's  just  what  we're  trying to do here and 
    several "advanced topics" are in separate files.  We do encourage you to 
    review these files to take full advantage of all of ATO's features.  For 
    further information consult the following documentation files: 
 
    ACLS.ARC   -   Contains both the ACLS accounting module and 
                   documentation. 
 
    ATOADV.ARC -   Contains documentation for using ATO's  script  language, 
                   and  ATO's  "address  book"  processor. 
 
    From time to time you may see terms used that don't make sense.   Here's 
    a quick run down on some of them: 
 
        PPN  -  Programmer  Project  Number; a user id 
        ATO  -  Shorthand for AUTOSIG. 
        SIG  -  Special Interest Group, or Forum 
        CIS  -  CompuServe Information Services 
        EMAIL - Electronic mail, or Easyplex

II.  Example Sessions with AUTOSIG 
______________________________________________________________________________


    A. Scanning the SIGs 
 
    You turn on AUTOSIG.  With the press of a single key AUTOSIG calls  CIS, 
    goes to each SIG you normally visit, gathers a list of all the  messages 
    that have  been posted  since your  last call  there; goes  to EasyPlex, 
    finds out if you have EMail,  and if so downloads it; then  AUTOSIG logs 
    off from CIS. You skim through the list of messages in each SIG, marking 
    only those whose subjects interest you.  Then you press another key  and 
    AUTOSIG calls  CIS again,  downloads the  messages you  have chosen, and 
    logs off. 
 
    At any  time you  choose you  can read  all the  messages that have been 
    downloaded.  (This means that you can  access CIS at 1200 or 2400  Baud; 
    since you  are not  reading the  messages online,  it doesn't matter how 
    fast they scroll by).   If you wish to  answer one of them,  a keystroke 
    puts you into  AUTOSIG's text editor  where you can  compose your reply, 
    referring back  to the  original message  as often  as you wish.  Finish 
    your writing, hit a couple of  keys, and your reply is stored  and ready 
    for  transmission  to  CIS.  (The  procedure  is  the same for Easyplex; 
    there's no second set of commands to learn in order to use EasyPlex.) 
 
    If  you  want  to  keep  a  particular  message  in  a permanent file, a 
    keystroke instructs AUTOSIG to save that message--and the permanent file 
    can be called up at any  time within AUTOSIG, or read by  other programs 
    such as LIST or a word processor. 
 
    Finally,  if  you  have  written  any  messages  to be posted on the SIG 
    message boards, one more keystroke makes AUTOSIG call CIS one more time, 
    leave your messages, and log off. 
 

    B. Using the SIG Data Libraries 
 
    ATO uses the Compuserve "B" error checking protocol, which for CIS users 
    is superior in speed and efficiency to the other main Compuserve option, 
    XMODEM.  For text files which don't require error checking, AUTOSIG will 
    capture them in a file for you. 
 
    You start AUTOSIG and choose which  SIG you want to visit.  A  keystroke 
    connects you  with CIS  and takes  you to  the SIG.  There you enter the 
    normal Compuserve  commands to  find and  download the  DL file  of your 
    choice.  If you  invoke the Compuserve  "B" option, a  status line shows 
    how the download is progressing.   When AUTOSIG notifies you that  it is 
    complete, you use the CIS command to log off. 
 
    Advanced users may  use ATO's script  language to write  "auto download" 
    scripts.

II.  Example Sessions with AUTOSIG 
______________________________________________________________________________


    C. Accessing Other Parts of Compuserve 
 
    AUTOSIG  can  be  used  as  a  simple  terminal;  you  can  use  it  for 
    conferences,  CB  rap  sessions,  getting  stock  quotes, and just about 
    anything else you can do on Compuserve.  You may do this manually or  by 
    the use of scripts. 
 
    If at  any point  you want  to check  the message  board at  one of your 
    favorite SIGS, a keystroke will  shift AUTOSIG into its automatic  mode. 
    Shifting  back  into  terminal  mode  is  just  as  easy.

III. System Requirements 
______________________________________________________________________________


    A. Hardware requirements 
 
    In general AUTOSIG requires the following equipment configuration: 
 
    An IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 or close compatible.  ATO has been tested on the 
    Compaq portable, the  Tandy 1xxx series  and the Leading  Edge, and runs 
    fine.  Other  close compatibles  might work,  but be  sure to check your 
    machine's users manual for various "switches" that might be necessary. 
 
    ATO will run on a PCjr using the internal modem.  See the file ATOJR.TXT 
    in the IBMJR Data Library  (currently DL7) for further information.   It 
    works with few  flaws on most  external modems.  Message  downloading is 
    not "buffered" so you'll drop some characters unless you've added DMA, a 
    resident program to buffer asynchronous communications, or capture to  a 
    RAM  disk.   The  CIS  Quick  B  protocol for file downloading will work 
    without problems. 
 
    At least 256k of  memory is required.  ATO  might run in less,  but with 
    different memory requirements for the different versions of DOS and  the 
    proliferation of various "terminate and stay resident" utilities 256k is 
    probably a minimum level.  More memory is recommended, especially if you 
    plan to run DOS commands from within ATO. 
 
    A modem capable of autodialing is required.  If you're not using a Hayes 
    AT-command  compatible  modem,  you'll  need  to  be  familiar with your 
    modem's command codes in order to set it up properly. 
 

    B. Operating System 
 
    DOS  3.1  or  greater  is  recommended.   ATO  will  run fine on DOS 2.x 
    systems,  but  you  may  experience  problems  with  the  "Shell to DOS" 
    feature.  ATO is aware of Double DOS and DesqView environments. 
 

    C. Network Access 
 
    You must be calling in through a CIS direct node, Telenet, Tymnet or  be 
    prepared to write your  own script to log  in.  With any luck,  and with 
    the typical sharing by ATO users, you may find a script already  written 
    for the network you use.  Browse DL1 of the IBMCOM forum with a  keyword 
    of  SCRIPT  and  see  what's  available.   With ATO's script ability you 
    should be able to logon via any network, but it might take some work  on 
    your part.  Examples are provided in the Advanced Users Guide.

IV.  Getting Started - Options 
______________________________________________________________________________


    A. Setting Options 
 
    Before you  can use  AUTOSIG you  must adjust  some of  your settings on 
    Compuserve,  customize  AUTOSIG  itself  for  your own use, and possibly 
    change some switches on your  modem.  Only then will ATO  and Compuserve 
    work smoothly together when you log in with AUTOSIG. 
 
    Here's a check list to help keep  track of what you have done and  still 
    need to do as you install AUTOSIG:

    B. Installing the AUTOSIG Files 
 
    The AUTOSIG program consists of the following supplied files: 
 
              AUTOSIG.EXE       - compiled, executable program 
 
              AUTOSIG.DOC       - this manual 
 
    These are the names used for  the current version, the one named  on the 
    title page.  The file names for other versions may differ. 
 
    Installation is complete once the EXE file has been placed on your  disk 
    and you  have adjusted  your boot  disk's CONFIG.SYS  file to  include a 
    FILES=20 statement.  If you're not familiar with the CONFIG.SYS file  or 
    if you have problems  adjusting its contents GO  IBMNEW and ask a  sysop 
    for assistance. 
 
    When you have  finished configuring AUTOSIG,  the program will  create a 
    file called AUTOSIG.DFN to save  your settings.  The DFN file  should be 
    on the same disk and in the same directory as AUTOSIG.EXE. 
 
    (Old-time AUTOSIG  users: the  name of  the configuration  file has been 
    changed from AUTOSIG.CFG to AUTOSIG.DFN because major changes have  been 
    made to the structure of ATO. This version of AUTOSIG will not work with 
    your old CFG file; be sure to set your ATO options and create a DFN file 
    before running  it.  Other  features have  been changed  too; while  the 
    update file will help,  and although we recognize  what a pain it  is to 
    read manuals, we ask that you skim through as much of this as you can.)

 C. Setting Options on Compuserve 


       1. SIG Options 
 
    Before  running  AUTOSIG,  certain  options  must  be  in effect in each 
    Compuserve SIG you  plan to visit.   Specifically, the prompt  character 
    (PC) must  be set  to ^G  (Control-G--the bell,  or beep  or some  other 
    prompt character that enables ATO  to detect that a certain  function or 
    prompt is being sent). 
 
    Using some program other  than AUTOSIG go to  each SIG, enter OP  at the 
    top menu/Function: prompt, and set this option: 
 
                PC ^G - (use Shift-6 for the ^ rather than the control key) 
 
    Note:  you  may  use  other  prompt  characters,  but  you  will have to 
    configure ATO  accordingly by  changing the  PC Options  or supplying  a 
    start-up command switch.  These features are explained later. 
 
                FO (Forum Mode) - Set this option to COMMAND 
 
    Optional!  More  than likely  you use  the  LINEDIT option,  the  editor 
    with the line numbers.  You may continue to use this editor with ATO, it 
    will work fine. 
 
    But you  may want  to change  your editor  to EDIT,  which is the editor 
    without line numbers.   If you choose  this option your  message uploads 
    will be faster!  However you might find that EDIT is a little harder  to 
    use if you leave messages in "real time". 
 
    To exit the OPtion area hit a carriage return to exit the area and  when 
    prompted enter a P to make the changes permanent. 
 
    You will not  hear the bell  while AUTOSIG is  running, but will  if you 
    access the CIS  SIGs using other  communications programs.  If  you like 
    you may  change the  prompt character  to something  else.  Personally I 
    prefer ^A,  but that  is a  matter of  preference.  Most  communications 
    program  have  a  "filter"  or  "strip  and  convert" option, so you may 
    convert a "7" (BEL) to a "0" (NUL) when using such programs. 
 
    You MUST make these changes in each SIG where you'll be using AUTOSIG!

 C. Setting Options on Compuserve 


       2. Terminal Options 
 
    You must also make sure that Compuserve's settings for your terminal are 
    set so that ATO will work properly. 
 
    Actually, Compuserve maintains  three different configurations  for your 
    user ID: at 300 baud, 1200 baud,  and 2400 baud.  You must log onto  CIS 
    at each transmission speed to  change the settings for that  speed.  You 
    will probably want to use AUTOSIG  at 300 baud for conferences, CB,  and 
    other services that require you to stay online to use them, and at  your 
    highest modem speed (usually 1200  or 2400, depending on your  hardware) 
    when downloading or uploading messages or DL files. 
 
 
    Go online with your communications program--not AUTOSIG--and from any  ! 
    prompt, enter GO TERMINAL. 
 
    1) Select menu item 5, "View or change .. parameters" 
 
    2) Select menu item 10, "Inquire for Vidtex.." and set it to OFF. 
 
    3) Hit a carriage return to exit 
 
    4) Select menu item 6, "Setting your...Options" 
 
    5) Select menu item 1, "You now receive" and set it to "Short Prompts". 
 
    6) Select menu item 2, "Paged Display" to "Disabled". 
 
    7) Hit a carriage return to exit. 
 
    8) Select menu  item 2 "Setting...Terminal  Type" and set  it to Vidtex. 
       This is  entirely optional  and will  not effect  the operation  of 
       ATO. Setting your terminal type to Vidtex is purely cosmetic. 
 
    9) Hit a carriage return to exit. 
 
   10) When  exiting the  TERMINAL area  you will  be asked  if the changes 
       should be effective for future sessions or for the session only. 
       Select menu item 1, "Make all changes effective for future sessions. 

    C. Easyplex Settings 
 
    As long as you're on-line you  should set yourself up in Easyplex,  even 
    if you don't  currently use it.   GO EASY to  get there and  select menu 
    option  #5,  "Address  Book",  then  entry #5, "Enter/Change your NAME". 
    That's it.

 C. Setting Options on Compuserve 


    D. On-Line Setting Recap 
 
    To summarize you must go on-line and: 
 
        o - Set your SIG options for  the Prompt Character and set Use Menus 
            to OFF. 
 
        o - Set your global  TERMINAL parameters for non-paged display, 
            enquire for Vidtex to OFF and set prompts to brief. 
 
        o - Add your name to your Easyplex mail box. 
 
    It's important  that each  of these  options be  set.  Otherwise AUTOSIG 
    will not see what it expects to  see and cause problems, so it's a  good 
    idea to spend some time to double check them.  The time you spend double 
    checking will be more than paid back in your first AUTOSIG session.

______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Modem Settings 

 
    As  mentioned  before,  ATO  comes  configured  for  use  with  a  Hayes 
    AT-command compatible  modem, as  well as  the capability  to accept any 
    modem commands.  Thus,  ATO is able  to support many  other modems.  The 
    ATO crew has access to a limited  number of modem types, so any tips  or 
    hints you have for using ATO on a certain modem would be very welcome. 
 
    If you're using a non-Hayes  modem, study your manual very  carefully to 
    determine  which  settings  correspond  to  the  ones specified here for 
    Hayes-compatibles.  In general,  set your modem to return the true state 
    of CD (carrier detect) and DTR (data terminal ready). 
 
    On Hayes  modems, the  setting of  the DTR  (Data Terminal Ready) switch 
    will determine  whether or  not the  modem is  disconnected when  ATO is 
    exited.  With the switch ON (or UP), the modem is disconnected, which is 
    normally what you will want. 
 
    The  following  modem  switch  settings  (for  a  Hayes  SmartModem) are 
    recommended: 
 
      1 - UP        Modem disconnects when ATO is exited. 
      2 - UP    V1  Modem sends result codes in English. 
      3 - DOWN  Q0  Result codes are sent to the terminal. 
      4 - UP    E1  Modem echoes characters while in command mode. 
      5 - DOWN      Modem will not answer phone. 
      6 - UP        Enables Carrier Detect sensing. 
 
    These  settings  are  optional.   If  the  settings  on  your  modem are 
    different go ahead and give it a try; chances are very good that it will 
    work.

 B. Setting Options Within AUTOSIG 

 
    You start ATO by  executing it with a  DOS command.  At the  DOS prompt, 
    enter the name of the AUTOSIG program: 
 
                            A>autosig 
 
    DOS  now  loads  the  program  and  begins its execution.  You should be 
    presented  with  the  ATO  Primary  Menu  (Figure  1).   If  nothing  is 
    displayed, your computer may not be  compatible with the way the IBM  PC 
    manages the monitor display.  You should then press the F10 key to  tell 
    ATO to terminate  and return to  the DOS. At  the DOS prompt,  enter the 
    characters /T.  This tells ATO to  use a different method of writing  to 
    your monitor. 
 
                            A>autosig /T

 C. Primary Menu 

 
    The  Primary  Menu  screen  contains  the  Host Selection menu, the Item 
    Selection menu, and the Forum Selection List.  Refer to Figure 1. 
 
    The Host Selection menu offers a choice of CompuServe services to call. 
 
    The Forum Selection List offers a choice of Forums (SIGs) to access. 
 
    The Item Selection menu selects the operation to perform. 
 
 
    For the first use of ATO, you must: 
 
        - edit the Host entries (press a number key) to supply your  userid, 
          password, the CIS phone number, and other service items. 
 
        - edit  the  Forum  entries  (press  a  letter key)  to identify the 
          forum(s) that you wish to access. 
 
        - edit the PC Options entries (press ESCape) to set colors,  printer 
          lines, mouse, beeper, etc. 
 
 
    You tell ATO  what to do  next by pressing  a key, or  by moving a mouse 
    cursor to the appropriate field and clicking the left button: 
 
        - Fn (function)  keys perform the  operations described in  the Item 
          Selection menu 
 
        -  <enter>  performs  the  operation  described  in whatever Item is 
          highlighted with the Item Selection bar 
 
        - TAB moves the Item Selection bar to the next item 
 
        - shift-TAB moves the Item Selection bar to the previous item 
 
        - alt-N resets all High Message Numbers to N<ew> 
 
        - PgDn or PgUp  selects the next or  previous Forum in the  list and 
          moves the "->" indicator 
 
        - down or up arrow selects the next or previous Host in the list and 
          moves the -> mark 
 
        - a number selects a Host and bring up its menu 
 
        - a letter from A to X selects a Forum and brings up its menu 
 
        - the letter Z highlights all forums which have "work", i.e. files 
 
        - ESCape selects the PC Options Menu for viewing and editing default 
          options such as the screen colors -- more about this later

 C. Primary Menu 

 
 
    The Forum Selection List comes preset with several predefined,  standard 
    forum entries.  None of  them is required, but  if you intend to  access 
    Easyplex, you  must have  an entry  containing the  word "mail," such as 
    EMAIL. 
 
    Adding your favorite SIGs to the Forum Selection List, or deleting those 
    already  there,  or  otherwise  changing  the presets, will be explained 
    below. 
 
    Pressing the  ESCape key,  or positioning  the Item  bar to "Reconfigure 
    PC," brings up  the Edit PC  Options menu in  the middle of  the screen, 
    overlaying the Item Selection menu.  Figure 2 shows a sample display  of

    These are advanced features that are normally not needed unless you have 
    compatibility  problems  with  your  computer,  or  you  have ATO up and 
    running and want to explore additional features.  You're probably  close 
    to info overload as it is so  you can skip this discussion if you  wish. 
    However, whenever you want to customize AUTOSIG's operation, this is one 
    way to do it, so keep it in mind. 
 
    Refer to Appendix B for a summary of command line switches.

    D. Specifying PC Options 
 
    "Normal Color f,b" -  This allows you to  set the colors to  be used for 
        the "f" foreground  and "b" background  for  non-highlighted  areas. 
        Refer to the BASIC manual COLOR command for a list of valid numbers. 
        Note: 7,0 may provide a better display on a monochrome monitor. 
 
    "Hilite Color f,b" - This setting allows you to set the color to be used 
        for highlighted messages and fields.  Refer to the BASIC manual  for 
        a list of valid codes. 15,0  may be better for monochrome.  The  new 
        color settings  take effect  when you  exit the  PC Options menu and 
        return to the Primary menu. 
 
    "Printer lines" - indicates where AUTOSIG's print function will issue  a 
        form feed. 
 
    "/H Skip  Retrace" -  Disables testing  of the  monitor's retrace.  This 
        results in faster displays, but may cause flicker on some  monitors. 
        This options does not apply to the use of monochrome monitors. 
 
    "/K Keep Email"  - Y tells  CIS to keep  (SAVE) Easyplex messages,  N to 
        DELETE them. 
 
    "/M Skip RM" - Used to suppress automatic [R]ead [M]arked function. 
 
    "/C CLS each message" - Enter Y to clear the screen when it fills,  thus 
        preventing scrolling.  Useful if  your color monitor flickers  while 
        lines roll on and off the screen. 
 
    "/B Disable kybd" - A Y locks the keyboard during auto functions.   This 
        allows you to supply ATO  console input through a batch  file system 
        or use a utility such as KEYFAKE or KEYIN to control ATO. 
 
    "/F Printer FF"  - Use Y  to eliminate most  form feeds that  are issued 
        when  you  P>rint  SIG  messages.   Your  messages  will  be printed 
        continuously with form  feeds issued only  as the printer  nears the 
        perforation or end of the page.  If you issue a LF or FF directly to 
        your printer, ATO's line counter will get out of synch. 
 
    "/S Sort QS hdrs" - Use Y  to instruct ATO to automatically sort the  QS 
        headers whenever the M>ark command is used. 
 
    "/T Slow screen" - Use Y to eliminate writing directly to the  monitor's 
        video display  buffer.  If  you're using  a clone,  and your  screen 
        blanks unexpectedly, try this switch. 
 
        ATO is compatible with DesqView, Double DOS, and APX Core.  You need 
        not use /T unless you have problems, i.e. blank or missing displays. 
 
    "/Q Quiet beeper" - Use Y to suppress most of the beeps and bells.

 C. Primary Menu 

    "/P Logon ^P" - Enter a Y to  have ATO send a ^P to CIS when  logging on 
        and  when  entering  a   forum.   This  bypasses  all   CIS  opening 
        announcements, SIG messages,  and announcements of  waiting messages 
        and Email.  (The AUTOSIG menus for individual SIGs have a ^P  option 
        too, but  this is  overridden if  you set  /P to  Y in  the Edit  PC 
        Options menu.)   Saves time,  but at  the risk  of missing something 
        important. 
 
    /G Prompt char - As already explained, the prompt character that AUTOSIG 
        normally recognizes is ^G, a bell control character.  If you wish to 
        respecify the prompt  character, enter the  new one here,  but do be 
        sure to set your SIG options to reflect the change! 
 

    E. Issuing Options on the Command Line 
 
    The "slash" options described above  can be specified when you  load the 
    AUTOSIG.EXE program by adding a space, "/", and a letter (upper or lower 
    case) to specify the option: 
 
        AUTOSIG /T /B /C 
 
    In effect, this command sets the /T, /B, and /C options to Y, overriding 
    whatever you have set within AUTOSIG using the Edit Options menu.  There 
    are other option "switches".  They are described in Appendix B. 
 

    F. Setting Up to Call CompuServe 
 
    AUTOSIG will  automatically log  onto CIS,  but only  if it  has certain 
    information which only  you can provide:  the CIS phone  number to dial, 
    your userid, your password, and your BAUD rate.  To set these and  other 
    options important for logging on,  select F3 Edit Host Options  from the 
    Item Selection menu.  This will  call up the Host Configuration  Options 
    menu (figure 3).   (The word "host"  refers to the  computer system that 
    you want ATO to access via the telephone--in this case, CompuServe.)

 G. Host Configuration Options 

    Even if you never call any other service than CIS, it's often convenient 
    to have several different host entries, as in the example: one for  each 
    BAUD rate you expect  to use, and one  for each node (telephone  number) 
    you may want to call. 
 
    The first nine items are specific to you and your CompuServe account and 
    must be set correctly before  you can use AUTOSIG.  The  remaining items 
    are preset and should need no change unless you have a modem that is not 
    Hayes-compatible,  or  unless  you  are  calling  some  other  host than 
    CompuServe or  otherwise want  to change  information.  If  this is your 
    first pass through the manual and you're ready to go check out the first 
    nine items and then "HOST connect response" if you're using 2400 baud. 
 
 
    "Host name" - identifies the system  that you are calling.  Enter a  one 
        to 17 character  name of your  choice, including blanks,  commas, or 
        any other characters.   The Host names  in the example  indicate the 
        BAUD rate. 
 
    "CIS phone number" - enter your  local CIS or net telephone number.   If 
        you access  CIS through  TYMNET, prefix  the number  with a  T, e.g. 
        T555-1212.  If you use TELENET, prefix the number with the letter G, 
        e.g.  G555-1212.  If  the phone number  is too long  to fit in  this 
        field, place the first part of  it at the end of the  Modem Commands 
        field.  ATO sends both fields to the modem when dialing. 
 
    "Your userid  " -  enter your  CIS numbers  separated by  a comma,  e.g. 
        70000,000. 
 
    "Your password  " -  enter your  CIS password.   (Special note: remember 
        that your password  will now be  on your diskette  or hard disk  and 
        remember to keep it  secure.  Though it may  be a hassle, do  change 
        your password  on CIS  periodically and  go through  the routine  of 
        changing it in  your configuration file;  it's worth the  extra time 
        and trouble.) 
 
    "Tymnet address " - if you are using Tymnet to access CIS, you may enter 
        the host name here. If omitted, the default is CIS02. 
 
    "Logon SCRipt file" -  Enter the name of  the external script file  that 
        should be executed at logon.  The script file is not executed  until 
        you  are  logged  on  to  CIS.  See  the  SCRIPT.ARC  file  for more 
        information on scripts. 
 
    "Userid prompt" - No need to  change this, unless CIS changes its  logon 
        prompt (doubtful). 
 
    "Password prompt" - See comment on "Userid prompt."

 G. Host Configuration Options 

 
    "What baud rate" - Enter the modem speed to be used, normally a value of 
        300, 1200 or 2400.  Other speeds such as 450 baud may be  specified, 
        but will work  only if your  CIS node supports  them.  ATO will  not 
        change the baud rate while you  are connected.  You must log off  to 
        change the baud rate. 
 
    "Modem dial commands" - The default commands are for the Hayes modem and 
        should  be  retained--unless,  of  course,  your modem is not Hayes- 
        compatible, in which case enter the appropriate commands here.  This 
        field may also be used to extend the telephone number.  The  default 
        contains "M0"; if you want  to hear the handshaking between  ATO and 
        CIS, delete these two characters. 
 
    "COMmunications port"  - enter  either COM1:  or COM2:  to specify which 
        Asynchronous Communications Adapter (port) is to be used.  The colon 
        is optional.  COM3 and COM4 can be specified, but may not work. 
 
    "Modem Connect text" - tells ATO what your modem sends when the phone is 
        connected.  The default is "CONNECT".  Whatever you enter here  will 
        appear on  the screen,  but ATO  ignores any  data after  the actual 
        modem code, so  that your text  may also state  the baud rate,  e.g. 
        "CONNECT 2400" or "CONNECT 1200," without affecting operations. 
 
    "Modem Disconnect text" - tells ATO what your modem sends when the phone 
        becomes disconnected.  The default is "NO CARRIER".  ATO also checks 
        for "BUSY" and  "NO DIALTONE".  The  special character ~  (tilde, or 
        squiggle) may be used to have ATO pause one second, a } (right curly 
        brace) to send a carriage return,  and a ^ (caret, or the  shifted 6 
        key) to indicate a control character such as ^D. 
 
    "Modem  Hang-up  command"  -  tells  ATO  what  to  send to the modem to 
        disconnect the phone.  The  default for a Hayes-compatible  modem is 
        ATH. 
 
    "Modem Reset command" - tells ATO what to send to the modem to reset it. 
        The  default  for  a  Hayes-compatible  modem  is  "~+++~ATZ", which 
        results in a one-second  pause, sending three plus  sign characters, 
        another one second-pause, and then the command ATZ. 
 
    "Host 1st ready prompt" - tells ATO  what the Host will send when it  is 
        ready for your requests.  The default is "CompuServe". 
 
    "Host  2nd  ready  message"  -  is  used  in addition to the first ready 
        prompt.  ATO waits for either the 1st or the 2nd ready message. 
 
    "Bulletin file name" -  If you want ATO  to save all CIS  logon messages 
        until the first Forum command  is sent, enter a filename  here, such 
        as AUTOSIG.BUL, for ATO to use.  Otherwise the bulletins will not be 
        saved.  Include the drive and path with the filename if the file  is 
        not to be kept in AUTOSIG's own disk or directory.

 G. Host Configuration Options 

    "HOST connect response" - This is  the code you send CompuServe to  tell 
        it you're ready to  go.  Normally a ^C  is what you'll want  to use. 
        In the case of 2400 baud MNP  nodes you'll want to use the tilde  to 
        delay sending the ^C.  The following entry should be adequate: 
 
          ~~~~~~~^C 
 
        This allows 7 seconds for  MNP handshaking after the CONNECT message 
        before the sending of the ^C. 
 
    "File transfer  d:\path" -  If you  want file  downloads to go somewhere 
        other than the  default drive or  sub-directory, enter the  path for 
        downloads here.  The following would cause all downloads to go to  a 
        sub-directory on drive C: called DOWNLOADS, 
 
          C:\DOWNLOADS

 H. Setting Up for Your SIGs 

 
    "SIG name"  - enter  a name  of up  to SEVEN  characters.  This  name is 
        displayed on the Function Menu.   Since this name is used  to create 
        files, be sure that it contains valid DOS filename characters.  That 
        is, do not use * (asterisk), ?  (question mark), or .  (period).  If 
        the name you give  is too long, ATO  will truncate it after  the 7th 
        character. 
 
    "GO to page" - enter the SIG "page number" or, if you prefer, the "quick 
        reference word," e.g.  IBMCOM. 
 
        Appendix A provides a list of forum names and their quick  reference 
        words.  For the most current list, GO INDEX on CIS and capture it as 
        an ASCII file. 
 
    "Hostname override" - if access to a Forum can only be made through  one 
        particular  Host,  then  supply  the  name  of  that Host here.  For 
        example, a Host called "CONFERENCE" may be useful for defining a 300 
        bps Host for CB or conferencing. 
 
    "Files drive:\path"  - tells  ATO which  drive and  directory to use for 
        access  to  its  files.   If  left  blank,  ATO will use the current 
        directory on the current drive.  You may supply a drive and/or  path 
        name--for example, C:\ATO. 
 
    Exceptions: The AUTOSIG.DFN file and the log (AUTOSIG.mth) files,  which 
    must be in  the same subdirectory  as AUTOSIG itself,  all files may  be 
    accessed from the drive and path named here. 
 
    "Starting msg # or N" - normally N is used so that all New messages  are 
        processed.  But a  message number can  be substituted.  This  number 
        replaces the CIS High Message Number (HMN) and is used by the QS, SF 
        and RF SIG-commands for the Q,  H and F functions.  For example,  if 
        you want  to review  all the  messages currently  available, you can 
        reset this  option to  0.  If  you prefer  to have  the SIG software 
        maintain your high message number simply type alt-N at the main  ATO 
        menu. 
 
    "Append message file" - Enter an N to erase the current message file and 
        create a  new one  whenever messages  are downloaded.   Enter a Y to 
        accumulate messages  in the  current message  file.  (An alternative 
        way to accumulate messages  in a file is  to S>ave them as  you read 
        them within AUTOSIG.)  If  you do enter "Y",  be sure to watch  free 
        disk space  carefully, and  edit message  files with  your editor or 
        word processor (or  erase them using  AUTOSIG's K>ill command)  when 
        space gets short. 
 
    "Log sessions" - Enter  a Y to record  on-line time in a  log file.  The 
        log file name is AUTOSIG.mmm, where 'mmm' is an abbreviation for the 
        current month.  Enter an N to disable logging. 
 
    "Stay connected" -  Enter a Y  if you wish  to remain connected  after a

        message upload/download session.  If  you want to visit  other areas 
        of the SIG for downloading or whatever during the current call  this 
        option should be set to Y.  Enter an N to disconnect from  CIS after 
        exiting this particular SIG. (The "AUTO" option keeps you  connected 
        until you have visited all the specified SIGs, regardless of how you 
        have set this option.) 
 
    "Send forum ^P"  - Enter a  Y to instruct  ATO to send  a ^P immediately 
        after a GO  page command.  This  suppresses all CIS  messages before 
        the Forum "Function:" prompt.   This mode is NOT  recommended simply 
        for the reason that you may miss important information in the  brief 
        bulletin. 
 
    "Sections (# or  ALL)" - Leave  this blank if  you intend to  access all 
        Forum subtopics, or if you prefer  to use the CIS OPtion command  to 
        manage your subtopics.  Otherwise, enter a list of subtopic numbers. 
        ATO will only access messages from those sections.  Refer to the CIS 
        "SS" command for more information.  "PPN file name" - If you wish to 
        use the AUTOSIG ppn (user id) directory facility enter the  filename 
        that should be used to store user ids and names. 
 
    When all  the Forum  Configuration Options  are set,  they are  saved by 
    using the ESCAPE key, and the new forum is added to the Forum  Selection 
    List.

 A. Forum Function Menu 

 
    Okay, lots  of work  so far  and no  fun.  Now  that the  Host and Forum 
    configurations are  complete and  correct let's  go online  and access a 
    SIG. 
 
    Select the Forum you want to visit from the Forum Selection List.   When 
    you do so, you will see  the Forum Function Menu (figure 5).   This lays 
    out all the things AUTOSIG can do for you, and the keystroke commands to 
    give.

    The menu is  divided into several  different areas.  Across  the top you 
    see a reminder of  what Forum you will  be accessing, and what  Host you 
    will be dialing to access it.  You can change the Host from this menu by 
    using the up and down arrow keys;  and if you've called up the menu  for 
    the wrong  Forum, you  can find  the right  one using  the PgUp and PgDn 
    keys.  (Or, if you prefer, hit C for Change Menus; this brings back  the 
    main menu  from which  you can  select the  Host and  Forum in the usual 
    way). 
 
    AUTOSIG functions are grouped into  those you want it to  perform online 
    with CIS, listed  on the left,  and those you  do before or  after a CIS 
    access, listed on the right.

 B. Function Menu Commands 

 

       (B) Beep on/off toggle 
 
      This toggles the BEEP that ATO sends when a session sequence or  error 
      has occurred.  The default is BEEP on. 
 

       (C) Change menus 
 
      Press C  to switch  to the  Main menu  This is,  among other things, a 
      quick way to select another SIG. 
 

       (1) AUTOmatic first pass 

       (2) AUTOmatic second pass 
 
      Invokes AUTO routines to access several SIGs automatically in one  CIS 
      session--discussed in detail below. 
 

       (E) Shell to new copy of COMMAND 
 
      Invokes DOS so that you may run other programs or enter DOS  commands. 
      ATO  remains  active  and  in  memory,  but the communications line is 
      suspended.  To  return to  ATO, enter  the EXIT  command to DOS. Shell 
      does not  work on  all systems.   You should  be using  PC DOS 3.0, or 
      later,  and  have  at  least  224K  plus  the DOS program size of free 
      memory. 
 

       (G) Go online, terminal mode. 
 
      Press G when you want to use AUTOSIG as a simple terminal program, for 
      example when downloading from or uploading to a SIG DL. ATO will  dial 
      CIS and log on,  and then leave you  to issue your own  commands.  See 
      below  for  details  about  the  function-key  and  alt-key   commands 
      available in  this mode.   To leave  terminal mode  and use  AUTOSIG's 
      automatic functions, enter ctrl-D or ctrl-X. 
 

       (K) Delete file 
 
      Use this option to erase/delete the message (M), save (S) file, header 
      (H) file and bulletin  file for the current  Forum.  You are asked  to 
      confirm the request and may respond with an N if you change your mind. 
 

       (L) List bulletins 
 
      If you have  supplied a bulletin  file name in  the Host Configuration

 B. Function Menu Commands 

      menu, press L to read any bulletins stored in it. 
 

       (N) Update DFN file. 
 
      This function  writes all  ATO information  to the  DFN file.  This is 
      normally done when ATO is properly exited, but you can use it whenever 
      you want to be sure, for  whatever reason, that the DFN file  has been 
      updated. 
 

       (O) Change Forum Options 
 
      Press  O  to  switch  to  the  Forum Configuration menu, where you can 
      change the settings  for the current  SIG (or, by  using the PgUp  and 
      PgDn keys, for any other SIG). 
 

       (P) Preview Leave/Reply file. 
 
      Press  P  to  "preview"  the  replies  and  original messages you have 
      already written, so that you can  revise or delete any of them  if you 
      wish before leaving them in the SIG. ATO loads [SIGname]L.ATO file  in 
      the message editor and presents the messages to you one by one.   When 
      you  have  disposed  of   the  last  message,  AUTOSIG   rewrites  the 
      [SIGname}L.ATO file to include your changes. 
 
      You may use the preview  function to change addressee and  other vital 
      data. 
 

       (S) Send new messages online. 
 
      Press S to send the original messages and replies in [SIGname]L.ATO to 
      the SIG. 
 
      Autosig provides insurance in case you have replied to a message  that 
      has been deleted before  you got back online.   If CIS can't find  the 
      original message, your  reply will be  left as if  it was an  original 
      message to the same addressee and with the same subject. 
 

       (V) View SAVEd messages. 
 
      If you  have saved  individual messages  while reading  them using the 
      S>ave command, you can view them from within AUTOSIG by pressing V. 
 
      After you have used AUTOSIG to go online, you may find that each Forum 
      menu  has  one  or  more  of  the  Offline  Message Processing options 
      highlighted.  That indicates that there  is an ATO file which  you can 
      read or otherwise process by pressing that letter.

 B. Function Menu Commands 

      Also, at the bottom of the  menu a "suggestion" letter will appear  in 
      the blank above "Select a function."  Normally, the letter is the  one 
      you would  press anyway  to perform  the next  logical step in dealing 
      with SIG messages; for instance,  if you've just finished using  the D 
      command to download messages, the letter R (for Read) will not only be 
      highlighted in the menu but will appear at the bottom, where it can be 
      selected by hitting the enter key. 
 

       (W) Write new messages offline 
 
      Not only replies but original messages can be prepared offline.  Press 
      W and you are placed in the Message Editor--discussed below--and asked 
      to name the addressee and supply a subject description. 
 

       (X) Exit to system 
 
      When you have  finished an AUTOSIG  session, and when  you have logged 
      off from CIS, press X to  leave AUTOSIG and return to the  DOS prompt. 
      If you are still connected when you press X, you will see this message 
      at the bottom of the screen: 
 
         "Exiting to DOS without logging off. OK? (y/N)" 
 
      Hit enter to  return to the  forum menu where  you can then  use the Z 
      (send OFF and disconnect) command, or, if you really want to exit  ATO 
      while connected reply with a 'Y'. 
 

       (Z) Send OFF and disconnect 
 
      This command allows you to send  the OFF command to CIS and  "hang up" 
      the phone.  Use  this option if  you are finished  with a CIS  access, 
      have the Forum Function menu on screen, and see the "PC is  connected" 
      message at the  bottom of the  menu.  There is  a pause of  about four 
      seconds after disconnection  so that you  may see any  final messages, 
      such  as  your  connect  time,  followed  by  the  prompt "[Disconnect 
      detected]".  Press ENTER to return to the Function Menu.

 C. Online Download Functions 

 
      The  most  commonly  used  methods  for  reading  sequences of CIS SIG 
      messages are available  on this menu.   Certain others, like  RI (Read 
      Individual msg#) and RS (Read Search), are available only in  terminal 
      mode. 
 

       (D) Download marked messages 
 
      When  you  have  completed  marking  the message headers, download the 
      actual messages by pressing D. AUTOSIG  will transmit a RT # ONLY  (if 
      the  headers  reflect  threads)  or  RI  #  (if  the  headers indicate 
      individual messages).  The downloaded messages are captured in a  file 
      named [SIGname]M.ATO--M for messages--that can be read and replied  to 
      within AUTOSIG. 
 

       (F) Read Forward 
 
      Downloads all messages  in message number  order by using  the CIS SIG 
      software RF (Read Forward)  command.  The messages are  read beginning 
      with  the  High  Message  Number  specified in the Forum configuration 
      option. 
 

       (Q) Quick Scan 
 
      Downloads  message  headers  using  the  CIS Quick Scan command.  Each 
      message header  represents one  or several  messages in  a thread, and 
      includes the  message number  (for the  first in  the current thread), 
      subject, subtopic, and number of replies only. 
 
      When all of the message  headers have been downloaded, ATO  returns to 
      the Forum Function  Menu, where you  can use the  (M)ark function (see 
      below) to select the messages you want to download and read. 
 
 

       (H) Scan Headers in message order 
 
      is similar  to Q,  except that  the message  headers are downloaded in 
      message  number  order  using  CIS's  Scan  Forward  command, and each 
      represents only one message each.  These headers include the From, To, 
      and Date fields in addition to those that are included when you  quick 
      scan. 
 

       (J) Scan headers in thread order 
 
      J is similar to H except  that headers are downloaded in thread  order 
      rather than in numerical order.

______________________________________________________________________________

 C. Online Download Functions 


       (T) Read Thread 
 
      Downloads all messages in thread order starting with the high  message 
      number (or N) that you  supplied in the Forum Configuration  menu.  In 
      effect, AUTOSIG issues an RTn (Read Thread) command. 
 

       (U) Download marked messages to you 
 
      is the equivalent of CIS's Read Marked from the Function: prompt.   It 
      will read all new messages on the SIG that are addressed to you. 
 

       (I) Download messages you sent 
 
      Downloads messages  that you  have sent  by using  the RS command with 
      your ppn. 
 

       (Y) Download all messages to you 
 
      Downloads all the messages addressed to your ppn that are still on the 
      message  board,  using  the  Read  Search  command and specifying your 
      userid in the "To:" field. 
 
      U, I, and Y are useful for a quick check to see if a message you  left 
      has  been  read  by  the  addressee  or  had any replies, or to delete 
      messages to or  from you that  have served their  purpose and have  no 
      general interest (or are  private and therefore inaccessible  to other 
      SIG members).  They are otherwise not a very efficient way to use  the 
      Forums or Autosig, so they are not prompted. 
 

    D. Intervening in an AUTOSIG session 
 
    During automatic operation, any  keyboard input (except ESCape)  is sent 
    to CIS. Thus, if an error occurs, you can type in the correct command or 
    response.  Often, when CIS responds to your typed command, AUTOSIG  will 
    pick up its automatic routine and carry it through. 
 
    If  you  wish  to  stop  automatic  processing,  for example if problems 
    develop that don't stop AUTOSIG by themselves, hit the ESCape key  twice 
    to enter Terminal Mode and regain control.

 F. Offline Message Processing 

 
      The various menu items are discussed here in the sequence in which you 
      are most likely to use them. 
 

       (M) Scan and mark messages offline 
 
      This step normally follows the downloading of message headers done  by 
      the ATO Q scanning command.  Press M and AUTOSIG will list the headers 
      one screen full at a time, as in Figure 6:

 F. Offline Message Processing 

    Press M  to mark  a message  to be  downloaded.  Press  any other key to 
    unmark a message so that it will not be downloaded. 
 
    You may S>ort the  headers by section number  at any time while  you are 
    marking  them.   Once  the  headers  have  sorted, they cannot be sorted 
    again.    The   sort   effects   the   order   that   the   messages are 
    downloaded. That  is,   unsorted  headers   result  in   messages  being 
    downloaded in chronological order, while sorted headers produce messages 
    in section number order. 
 
    When the last screen-full of message headers is displayed, the top  line 
    of the screen includes the word BOTTOM: 
 
           Marking messages:  28 headers; HMN= 28580        BOTTOM   6-28 
 
    The menu at the bottom of the  screen offers two ways to leave the  Mark 
    function.  Press Q for Quit and  your markings will be recorded for  use 
    when ATO  next accesses  the SIG.  The Esc  key aborts  the function and 
    discards your marks.  Important tidbit here!  The Quit function  deletes 
    the header file so all desired headers must be marked in one  "session". 
    If you mark some, exit and then return for further marking the file will 
    no longer exist. 
 
    If you have elected to use the  H or J command the following display  is 
    presented: 
 
                   Msg# xxxxxx S3/Video/EGA (H)

       (D) Download marked messages 
 
      When  you  have  completed  marking  the message headers, download the 
      actual messages by pressing D. AUTOSIG  will transmit a RT # ONLY  (if 
      the  headers  reflect  threads)  or  RI  #  (if  the  headers indicate 
      individual messages).  The downloaded messages are captured in a  file 
      named [SIGname]M.ATO--M for messages--that can be read and replied  to 
      within AUTOSIG. 
 

       (R) Read and reply offline 
 
      Press R and the messages in [SIGname]M.ATO will be displayed, one at a 
      time, for you to  read and, if you  wish, to answer.  If  a message is 
      too long to fit on a screen, a "more" prompt will appear in the  lower 
      right hand side  of the screen.   Hitting the Return  key will display 
      the rest of the message. 
 
      Here is how to navigate through the sequence of messages: 
 
          <enter> to display the next screen 
          <PgDn>  to skip to the next message 
          <PgUp>  to display the previous message 
          <HOME>  to display the first message 
          <END>   to display the last message 
          <X>     to skip out of the current thread and go to the next 
 
      The following option list is displayed at the end of each message: 
 
    Msg: #1234 <Enter> Quit Bak/Top/End/Agn Loc/Nxt Ma Hdr/Pr/Sav Re/Ua/Join 
  __________________________________________________________________________ 
 
  Q>uit  terminates  the  (R)ead  function  and  returns  you  to  the Forum 
         Function Menu. 
 
  B>ack  displays  the  message  immediately  before  the  current  message. 
         Multiple messages  can be  displayed by  issuing the  B>ack command 
         several times. 
 
  T>op   returns you to the top of the message file, displaying the  message 
         in the file.  You may also use the HOME key for this purpose. 
 
  E>nd   is the  opposite of  T>op, taking  you to  the last  message in the 
         file.  You may also use the END key. 
 
  A>gain redisplays the same message--useful when you are reading the second 
         page of a long message and want to get back to page 1. 
 
  L>ocate finds a string in the current message file.  The L>ocate  function 
         searches  (forward  only)  throughout  the  whole  file, not simply 
         within the particular message shown onscreen.  When asked to  enter

         the text string to  be located, you may  type up to 128  characters 
         including blanks,  commas, or  any other  special characters.   The 
         search   is   case-sensitive;   that   is,   you   must   match the 
         capitalization of the text you are searching for. 
 
  N>ext  repeats the L>ocate search until the end of the file is reached. 
 
  M>ail  is like  the R>eply  command (see  below) except  that the reply is 
         mailed to an EasyPlex user.  AUTOSIG issues a MA command instead of 
         the S command. 
 
  H>dr   causes a  printer formfeed  and prints  the current  message to the 
         printer.  This is handy when you want a single message on  hardcopy 
         as in comparison to the P>rint command. 
 
  P>rint copies the current message to the printer.  A title line is printed 
         at the top of  the first page, giving  the name of the  SIG and the 
         current time  and date.   The system  printer, LPT1,  is used.  ATO 
         will send a form feed when  it thinks that a printer page  is full. 
         Use ATO's PC  Options menu to  specify how many  lines per page  to 
         print. 
 
  S>ave  appends  the  current  message  to  a file named [SIGname]S.ATO for 
         archiving. 
 
         There are three ways to reply to a message, indicated by the 
         Re/Ua/Join series of commands: 
 
  R>eply addresses your new message to the sender of the original, using the 
         name  and  PPN  as  they  appear  there, and also uses the original 
         message's subject description.  This continues the thread to  which 
         the original message belongs. 
 
  U>A    uses the ppn of  the sender of the  original message, but lets  you 
         supply a new subject description.  This begins a new thread. 
 
  J>oin  lets you  send a  message to  the addressee  of the  message you're 
         reading; it  lets you  "join" the  conversation in  a different way 
         than by replying.  Join lets you supply a new subject description. 
 
        If you choose to reply using any of these options, you are placed in 
        the Message Editor--discussed in detail later in this manual. 
 
        Upon completing your reply, it is stored in the [SIGname]L.ATO  file 
        to be  sent ("left")  when you  go online,  and the  next message is 
        automatically presented for you to read. 
 
  D>elete - If you are replying to a message addressed specifically to  you, 
         you may have it  deleted at the same  time that AUTOSIG posts  your 
         reply in the SIG, by pressing D while reading it.

    Not all  commands are  available for  every message.   For example,  the 
    D>elete command  is offered  only for  messages you  wrote or  that were 
    addressed to you.  Similarly, if  you're reading a S>ave file,  which is 
    archival, rather than an active file, the various functions for replying 
    are not available. 
 
    A note not related to ATO  but on general SIG "procedure".  It's  a good 
    idea to allow a message addressed to you so that others may benefit from 
    it.  This is especially true if you've posted a question and delete  all 
    replies.  Others will see that you  didn't get a reply and it  generally 
    turns into a wheel spinning contest. 
 
    It is consider good form to delete messages that wouldn't be of interest 
    to others.  This would include simple 'thanks' type messages and private 
    messages.

 G. AUTOSIG Working Files 

 
    In addition to the AUTOSIG.DFN file, ATO creates quite a few files while 
    it runs.   Each file  has a  name in  this format: [SIGname]X.ATO, where 
    "SIGname" is the name you have given to a CompuServe forum in the  Forum 
    Configuration menu  and X  is a  one-letter code  indicating the  file's 
    function.  For example, file IBMCOML.ATO is a file of messages you  have 
    written that are to be "left" in the IBMCOM Forum message board. 
 
 
    H - message headers,   the result  of functions  Q and  H. Erased  after 
        headers have been marked  and the corresponding messages  downloaded 
        from CIS by AUTOSIG. 
 
    M - downloaded messages, from functions F, T, D, U, I, A, and Y. 
 
    L - messages  to be left  on CIS, from  function (W) or  from one of the 
        reply options of functions (R or V). Erased after messages have been 
        transmitted by AUTOSIG. 
 
    S - an archival message file, from the S>ave option of function (R). 
 
    R - a temporary file  created for downloading messages and  erased after 
        those messages have been entered in the M file. 
 
 
    If you use the archive command (alt-F4) in the editor to save a  message 
    that you have  written, the file  created is named  "signame.FIL", where 
    the "signame" is the current Forum name. 
 
    These files are searched for on the current drive and in the current 
    directory, unless you supply an optional DOS environment setting for 
    the ATO variable. For example, to tell ATO to use the C drive and the 
    path named ATO, you would supply the DOS command: 
 
                SET ATO=C:\ATO 
 
    before starting ATO. The bulletin file always uses the current drive and 
    directory.

______________________________________________________________________________

 H. CIS High Message Number 

 
    The starting message # (or "HMN") field on the Forum Configuration  menu 
    is automatically updated with the last message number scanned by AUTOSIG 
    using the Q  or H command.   This prevents ATO  from repeating the  same 
    headers the next time it is  used to scan.  It is necessary  because the 
    CIS  scanning  commands  SF(N)  and  QS,  which AUTOSIG uses for its own 
    functions, do not update the High Message # in the SIG. 
 
    It may be that you find it  easier to have the SIG software manage  your 
    high message number.   If so hit  Alt-N at the  main ATO menu  and ATO's 
    internal high message number will be reset to N>ew. 
 
    Although CompuServe assigns no message numbers to EasyPlex messages, ATO 
    automatically numbers Email messages for reference purposes, and updates 
    its  HMN  field  accordingly.   You  may  choose  any starting number by 
    editing the forum options for your Email entry.

 A. Multiple SIG Sessions 

 
    AUTOSIG offers two ways to access several SIGs during one logon.  To  do 
    it  automatically,  see  the  section  on  "AUTO".  You can also use the 
    O>ptions menu to instruct AUTOSIG to stay connected as you move from SIG 
    to SIG. 
 
    You may "run" functions on multiple SIG's with AUTOSIG, but it  requires 
    that  you  set   the  "Stay  Connected"   option  in  the   initial  SIG 
    configuration to "Y(es)".  The procedure for multiple SIG actions during 
    one connect sessions are as follows: 
 
        1) Select the first SIG you want to visit.  Make sure that the  stay 
           connected option is set to yes. 
 
        2) Select the function menu option to perform the task you want. 
 
        3) After the call is placed and the RUN option is executed you  will 
           be presented with  the main AUTOSIG  menu again.  The  message in 
           the upper right hand of the screen should display the message "PC 
           is connected".  You are still connected. 
 
        4) Use the PgDn key (change to another SIG) to bring up the new  SIG 
           configuration files on the disk. 
 
        5) Select the letter for another SIG. 
 
        6) After the new SIG is selected enter the option for that SIG (i.e. 
           Q,F,H,T,S, etc.). 
 
        7) Repeat this process for as many SIG's as you want to visit. 
 
        8) Unless the last SIG you visit has the "Stay connected" option set 
           to "N(o)" in the configuration, select the Z option from the main 
           AUTOSIG menu to send CIS a OFF command to disconnect.

 B. AUTO - Automatically Access Several SIGs 

 
    AUTO is a feature of ATO that enables an internally-generated batch file 
    for AUTOSIG.  Menu-driven,  it permits specifying  a routine for  ATO to 
    follow for online sessions.  The batch  file is stored in the DFN  file. 
    Refer to Figure 7 for an example of the AUTO Build menu. 
 
    There are three parts to AUTO: 
 
        -  the AUTO list, which you create using the ATO menu editor 
 
        -  the first AUTO pass, also referred  to as /1 or 1 or F1; in which 
           ATO  automatically  accesses  CIS  to  download  Email  messages, 
           messages headers, or message threads 
 
        -  the second AUTO pass, also referred to as /2 or 2 or F2; in which 
           ATO processes your  offline requests such  as sending replies  or 
           download marked messages 
 
    If you  have never  defined an  AUTO list,  you will  need to select the 
    Modify AUTO  list item  from the  Primary menu.   You are then presented 
    with an AUTO  list of forums  and commands.  Move  the cursor next  to a 
    forum you  wish to  access automatically.   Enter the  letters for  each 
    command  that  you  wish  to  perform,  e.g.   Q  to download Quick Scan 
    headers.  You  may delete  a forum  from the  AUTO list  by entering all 
    blanks after the  forum name.  Press  the ESCape when  you are finished, 
    and you are returned to the  Primary menu.  Your AUTO list has  now been 
    stored in the AUTOSIG.DFN file. 
 
    AUTO can be enabled in many ways: by using " /1" as part of your command 
    to load  AUTOSIG, e.g.,  "AUTOSIG /1".   (The space  before the slash is 
    necessary.)  Use the " /1" extension only if a routine has already  been 
    created.  Or you can  select the pass 1  (F1) or pass 2  (F2) items from 
    the Primary  menu, or  use the  1 or  2 commands  from the main Function 
    menu. 
 
    Any routine created is saved  and becomes permanent until changed.   ATO 
    can then be run normally  or with the " /1"  or " /2" switches, or  from 
    the F1  or F2  keys at  the Primary  menu.  The  /1 and  /2 switches are 
    different  from  the  F1  and   F2  keys.   The  switches  invoke   AUTO 
    immediately. 
 
    The F1 and F2 keys require that  you enter the time of day when  AUTO is 
    to execute.  If you just press the <enter> key, AUTO begins immediately. 
    Otherwise, you may enter the time  and/or day when AUTO is to  run.  The 
    time must be supplied  in the format "hh:mm"  where "hh" is the  hour in 
    military/24 hour format, and "mm"  is the minutes.  For example,  if you 
    want AUTO pass 1 to begin at 4:35 pm, you would enter 16:35. 
 
    If AUTO is to start on another  day, you supply the date after the  time 
    in the format ",mm-dd" where the  coma is required between the time  and 
    date, and "mm" is the current  month number (e.g. 9 for September),  and 
    the "dd is the day of the month.  For example, to start AUTO at 4:35  pm

 B. AUTO - Automatically Access Several SIGs 

    on September 9, enter "16:35,09-09" when asked "When?". 
 
    AUTO will S>end or D>ownload messages automatically as well.  After  the 
    first pass with AUTO, the "2" option can be used.  Selecting this causes 
    AUTO to scan your disks to see if there are messages waiting to be  sent 
    or downloaded.  If there are, ATO will go online again to perform  those 
    functions.  If you have returned to DOS in the interim, the extension  " 
    /2" will do the same thing. 
 
    AUTO stays in this  mode until you return  to DOS. Because of  this, you 
    can use  the (Q) option for  a quick  scan; use  " /2"  to download  the 
    messages; R>ead them  offline; compose replies  offline; and then  use " 
    /2" again to S>end replies. 
 
    IMPORTANT: Whenever  you select  AUTO, whether  /1 or  /2, it checks all 
    forums in the AUTO list which have  commands to see if there are any (D) 
    or (S) files.  If a forum  has all blanks,  it is not  accessed, whether 
    there are (D) or (S) files for it or not. 
 
    If you'd prefer to use ATO without AUTO, it can still help.  You can use 
    " /2"  anytime you  want to  go online  to download  messages you marked 
    offline, or to send  new messages.  It's a  good way to see  how quickly 
    AUTO works, and you won't be taken back online unless you have a live D> 
    or (S) file.  In use, the main menu item of choice offline becomes "C". 
 
    Also, your O>ption choice of "Y" or "N" for "Stay connected y/n" in your 
    AUTOSIG.DFN file is overridden by AUTO, so there's no need to change  it 
    from what you normally use 'manually.'  You can exit out of AUTO  at any 
    time by  hitting <Esc>  <Esc>.  If  you do  it before  your modem  sends 
    "CONNECT", AUTO will hang up and return you to the main menu; otherwise, 
    from what you normally use 'manually.'  You can exit out of AUTO  at any 
    ready for keyboard input.

VIII.  EasyPlex (E-Mail) Operation 
______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Setup and Operation 

 
    Although SIG and  Forum messages are  one way of  communicating when you 
    know that  the addressee  will check  the forum,  AUTOSIG makes  sending 
    messages via CIS's electronic  mail system ("EasyPlex") simple.   It's a 
    good idea to use EasyPlex when you're not sure if the recipient is going 
    to be on the SIG in time  to pick up the message before it  scrolls off. 
    In AUTOSIG's  Email routine,  messages are  reformatted so  they can  be 
    handled just like SIG messages.  You may also send EMAIL by composing  a 
    reply to a forum message and then using the M or MA option. 
 
    When you  use AUTOSIG  for the  first time,  or if  your main drive disk 
    doesn't have  a .DFN  file created  by AUTOSIG,  the menu  will offer at 
    least two  selections: IBMCOM  and EMAIL.   Instructions for  IBMCOM are 
    elsewhere.  Select the menu letter for EMAIL (probably 'B'), then select 
    the Edit HOST Options  item, F4. You are  presented with a Host  Options 
    menu for editing.  Change  the CIS phone number  and enter your ID#  and 
    password.  The 'Forum name' must  contain "MAIL", "Mail" or "mail";  the 
    CIS page number must be "EASYPLEX" or "EASY" for this part of AUTOSIG to 
    work correctly. 
 
    Next, go online  normally and set  the options as  describted earlier in 
    this manual.  The importance of the set up can't be stressed enough,  if 
    they aren't properly set up ATO just won't work. 
 
    With the correct parameters, EasyPlex will appear to be identical to the 
    SIGs, with only a couple of exceptions: 
 
        - The "To:" prompt will only accept a CIS ID number.  If you forget, 
          AUTOSIG will remind you. 
 
        - Some AUTOSIG menu options, because of the way EasyPlex works,  are 
          not available.  <Q>uick scan  and <M>ark,  for example  don't work 
          with EasyPlex. 
 
        - Email messages are numbered  by ATO beginning with number  1.  You 
          may  change  this  starting  number  by  selecting  the Edit Forum 
          Options item from the Primary menu, and changing the High  Message 
          Number (HMN) for your EMAIL forum. 
 
    ATO may contain a SIG defined for Email, even if you never intend to use 
    this feature.  The name of the 'SIG' can be changed, but it must contain 
    "MAIL", "Mail", or "mail". 
 
    If ATO freezes while using the Email function, it's probably because you 
    haven't entered your name in the EasyPlex address book (see above). 
 
    The prompt character is not used by ATO during Email operation. 
 
    Binary  EMAIL  messages  are  automatically  downloaded  using the CIS B 
    protocol.  The  resulting file  has a  name of  the form  "EMAILMSG.nnn" 
    where 'nnn' is the message number assigned by ATO.

IX.  ATO Terminal Mode 
______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Overview 

 
    In addition  to automatic  access to  CompuServe, ATO  can be  used as a 
    simple terminal program.  This enable you to 
 
               - go to other CIS areas 
               - upload or download files from DL data libraries 
               - save CIS information in a disk file 
               - use split screen in a COnference 
 
    Terminal mode  in entered  by selecting  function option  (G).  You  are 
    given  the   option  to   automatically  logon   to  CIS.   The  current 
    configuration setting is  used for dialing  and page information.   When 
    you enter the  SIG via the  "Go on-line" function  ATO sends the  string 
    "OP;SED;SM N ;S" which will put you in non stop mode.  You may  manually 
    send OP;SM A;S to put you back into stop between message mode. 
 
    Terminal mode  is also  entered when  the "ESCape"  key is entered twice 
    from  the  keyboard  while  ATO  is  online.  To exit terminal mode, and 
    return to the Function Menu, enter a "ctrl-D" key combination.  You  are 
    asked: 
 
                  "Have you left forum-name? (y/N) 
 
    If you went to another forum while in terminal mode, reply Y. Otherwise, 
    press enter.  If you have set "Stay connected" in your forum options  to 
    No, you are  asked: "Stay connected?   (Y/n)".  Reply Y  if you want  to 
    stay connected and access more forums.  Otherwise, reply N and ATO  will 
    log you off. You can avoid this prompt by using ctrl-X instead of ctrl-D 
    to return to the main Forum function menu. 
 
    If your terminal is defined as a Vidtex terminal, ATO recognizes most of 
    the special escape sequences for clearing the screen and positioning the 
    cursor.   Please  note  that  Vidtex  escape sequences are NOT processed 
    until  you  enter  terminal  mode!    This  is  done  only  to   improve 
    performance.  Once you  are on-line in  terminal mode all  Vidtex escape 
    sequences will be executed.

______________________________________________________________________________

 B. Defining Function Keys 

 
    The keyboard keys F1 through F10 are available as Program Function Keys. 
    Pressing one of these keys "sends"  a command that you have assigned  to 
    the key.  Function key  definitions are saved in  the DFN file for  each 
    SIG. You create (or modify)  these definitions by using the  "alt-K" key 
    combination. 
 
    Alt-K results in a  display of the current  key definitions.  This is  a 
    small window in the upper right  corner of the display.  Use the  cursor 
    positioning keys  and other  keyboard keys  to add  or modify data.  The 
    Enter  key  moves  to  the  next  key definition line.  All function key 
    strings  are  sent  automatically  when  pressed.   A carriage return is 
    automatically appended  to the  text unless  it end  in a  left brace  { 
    character. 
 
    You do not need  to be online to  define these keys.  Select  G>o online 
    for AUTOSIG's main menu, and you'll be prompted to determine if you want 
    to go online.  Reply "N", and then hit the Alt-K key combination. 
 
    Use the ESCape  key to end  the editing of  the key definitions,  and to 
    return  to  Terminal  Mode.   The  first  six characters of each key are 
    displayed, as a  reminder, on line  25 of the  display whenever Terminal 
    Mode is entered.  You may remove the line 25 display by using the  alt-C 
    keys. 
 
    The function key text may contain these special characters: 
 
        {  left brace, suppresses adding a carriage return to the text 
        ~  tilde, causes a one second pause before processing the next 
           character. The tilde is not transmitted. 
        ^  caret, identifies the next character as a control character, 
           for example:  ^C for control-C,  ^P for control-P,  etc.

 D. Terminal Mode Special Keys 

    While in Terminal Mode, ATO assigns special functions to these keys: 
 
    alt-A     displays a list of alt- keys that you may use 
 
    alt-B     toggles the sending of beeps and bells 
 
    alt-C     clears the  screen and removes  the line 25  display of the 
              F-key definitions. Use  ctrl-HOME  to  restore  the display of 
              the bottom line f-keys 
 
    alt-D     initiates Downloading into a capture file; same as alt-L 
 
    alt-E     invokes a DOS shell so that you may execute other programs 
              without exiting ATO 
 
    alt-F     displays the names of files on a selected drive 
 
    alt-G     Gathers the forum section/topic names and saves them in the 
              DFN file. You can display these with the alt-N command, or at 
              the Leave/Reply prompt by entering a question mark (?). 
 
    alt-H     sends modem commands to hang up and disconnect 
 
    alt-I     lets you execute one script command immediately

    E. Protocol File Transfer 
 
    Files from the CIS data libraries (DLs) may be "downloaded" from CIS  to 
    your system by using ATO in the Terminal Mode.  You tell CIS to download 
    a file by using commands such as  READ, TYPE, or DOW when you are  given 
    the DL: prompt by CIS, or from  the file prompt given at the file  level 
    during the BRO command. 
 
    To  enter  Terminal  Mode,  select  the  (G) Go Online function from the 
    Function  Menu,  or  press  the  ESCape  key  while ATO is performing an 
    automatic function such as T or simply change the forum option to  "stay 
    connected". 
 
    ATO uses CIS "Quick B" protocol  if you need to know.  Chances  are it's 
    so automatic the point will be moot as we'll see. 
 

    F. Downloading with "B" protocol 
 
    If you use  the BRO command  just hit the  PgDn key and  everything from 
    there  on  out  will  be  automatic.   The  filename as used by the Data 
    Library will be  used on your  system and absent  an entry in  the "File 
    transfer  d:\path"  field  in  the  HOST  configuration the file will be 
    placed in the current drive or sub-directory. 
 
    After that,  the transfer  is automatic.   You'll see  received block  # 
    messages,  and  after  the  transfer  you'll  see  number  of characters 
    transferred,  elapsed  time  and  characters  per second.  The NAK value 
    represents  the  number  of  times   CIS  requested  that  a  block   be 
    retransmitted.  The ENQ value should be zero.  If not, CIS has tried  to 
    interrupt the file transfer and ATO may have trouble continuing. 
 
    The top line of the display during CIS Quick B file transfers tells  you 
    the  name  of  the  file  and  when  the  transfer  started.  If you are 
    uploading a file, the file's size is also displayed. 
 
    The bottom  line of  the display  is a  status line.   It tells  you the 
    number of bytes of "File:" that have been transferred to or from a file, 
    the  number  of  bytes  "Sent:"  and  "Rcvd:", and the number of "Naks:" 
    negative response due to errors and re-transmissions.  The "File:" count 
    is updated every 32 bytes for 300/1200 bps, and every 64 bytes for  2400 
    bps operation. 
 

    G. Uploading with "B" protocol 
 
    Files  may  also  be  uploaded  (sent)  to  DL  databases  using the "B" 
    protocol.   Use  the  UPL  command  and  follow the directions from CIS. 
    Please  follow  file  name  conventions.   Basic programs saved as ASCII 
    files should be uploaded with the extension, .BAS.  Text files may  have 
    any three-letter extension.  Please refer  to the file DL.HLP in  DL1 of

    IBMNEW for further information on filename conventions. 
 

    H. Alt-L  Log to disk 
 
    The  "alt-L"  (or  alt-D)  key  combination  is  used to start (or stop) 
    logging to disk.  Any data sent by CIS - messages, etc. - are written to 
    a disk  file until  the "alt-L"  key combination  is used  again to stop 
    logging.  The log file is also closed after exiting Terminal Mode. 
 
    The letter C appears in the  lower right corner of the screen  to remind 
    you that file capture is in progress. 
 
    To "download" text files or Basic programs saved in ASCII format,  while 
    you're BROwsing through the Data Library, select "R" (without <Enter> ); 
    hit Alt-L; name the file as requested by ATO and then hit <Enter> twice. 
    When the download is complete  (CIS sends 'Key <Enter> to  continue) hit 
    Alt-L again to close the file on your PC, followed by <Enter>. 
 

    I. Alt-U  Upload from disk 
 
    The "alt-U"  key combination  initiates an  ASCII (not  protocol) upload 
    operation.  You may supply  a prompt character for  ATO to wait for,  or 
    you may let ATO upload the file without any delays.  You supply the name 
    of a file to be transferred to CIS.

X.   Message Editor 
______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Description of use 

 
    The AUTOSIG editor is  a full screen editor  which makes use of  most of 
    the  special  function  keys  on  the  PC  keyboard  as  well as ALT key 
    combinations.  Generally speaking most of the commands and functions are 
    intuitive if  you've used  a text  editor before.   Being a  full screen 
    editor you can  move around the  screen using the  cursor keys and  make 
    changes as  you wish.   Additionally you  can insert,  reformat, cut and 
    paste, import and in general do anything you want. 
 
    Those who have used previous versions  of ATO will note that the  editor 
    will now allow you to enter a blank line.  As you may know a blank  line 
    in the SED Sig EDitor is an indication that you want to end the session. 
    Not  to  worry,  ATO  will  insert  the  necessary  formatting  codes to 
    accommodate blank lines.  If you're using the SIG EDIT editor the  blank 
    lines are sent.  In both cases you'll get the blank line in there. 
 
    The screen consists of 25 rows by 80 columns.  The first 23 rows contain 
    message lines.  Row  24 contains the  addressee and subject  information 
    for  the  Leave  or  Reply  message.   Row  25  lists  the  function key

    You may hit the F1 function key for help in the editor. 
 
    Each  message  line  is  numbered,  from  1  to 80, in column 78 of each 
    display row.  You may position the cursor to any line on the display, or 
    use the <Enter> key to position to the next line. 
 
    The maximum number of lines you may enter is 96, but Forum messages  are 
    limited to about  2000 characters, or  about 25 lines.   The editor will 
    warn you of this when you reach the 20th character.  You should end  the 
    message, and start a new one if necessary to continue.  The limit of  96 
    lines is necessary for EasyPlex  messages which can be much  larger than 
    Forum messages. 
 
    The editor has full  wordwrap.  It will advance  to the next line  at an 
    appropriate point.  In addition you can force a reformat of the the rest 
    of a paragraph as you as you edit by using the alt-f function. 
 
    The TAB key moves  the cursor to the  next TAB column.  The  TAB columns 
    are 1, 9, 17,  25, etc.  The ctrl-left  key skips to the  previous word, 
    the ctrl-right key skips to the next word. 
 
    The INSERT function (F5) adds a blank line AFTER the current line. 
 
    The DELETE function (F6) deletes the current line. 
 
    Lines are added to the end when ENTER is used on the last line.

 C. Editor Import Function 

 
    You press F9 to tell  ATO to import a file.   This allows you to read  a 
    file into the editor  work area.  Thus, you  can insert data from  files 
    directly into your messages. 
 
    When you press F9, ATO asks you to where to find the file: 
 
               Enter import d:\path [C:\ATO] 
 
    You  may  press  enter  to  use  the  Forum options drive and path (e.g. 
    C:\ATO), or you may type in a new drive and path. 
 
    Next, ATO displays a list of files in that directory.  For example: 
 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
   AUTOSIG .DFN AUTOSIG .JUN ATODOC  .001 ATO   .EXE ACLS  .EXE PANELS  .2 
   IBMCOMM .ATO IBMCOML .ATO IBMCOMS .ATO 
 
    File to import: 
 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
    Enter the name of the file you wish to Import, or press Enter to  change 
    to another directory.  If  ATO can not find  the file, you will  receive 
    the message: 
 
            filename not found. 
            Key 'X' to abort; any other key to retry. 
 
    Press X to  cancel the import  request, or press  Enter to re-enter  the 
    drive and path names. 
 
    When you import a file while  writing a message, that file becomes  part 
    of the message you are writing, and it is displayed.  Because files with 
    the extension  ".ATO" are  in the  precise format  of CIS messages, they 
    cannot be imported, and an error message will be displayed.

______________________________________________________________________________

 D. Replying to messages 

 
    When you select F4 or Alt-F4, you are presented with the options: 
 
    S>ave, P>rivate, U>nformatted, X>SPU, M>ail, Y>MU, R>eturn to editing 
 
 
  "S" will  send the  message and  permit CIS  to reformat  it to the screen 
      format set by anyone who reads it. 
 
  "U" will send the message exactly  as written.  This is convenient if  you 
      include tables in a message. 
 
  "P" sends  the message  privately on  SIGs where  this option  is enabled. 
      IMPORTANT:  AUTOSIG  does  not  trap  errors  if you attempt to send a 
      (P)rivate message on a SIG where the Sysop does not allow this type of 
      message.   Don't  use  this  option  unless  you're certain that it is 
      permitted. 
 
      At this writing, the IBM Forums allow private messages. 
 
  "X" sends the message Privately, as is, and instructs CIS to not  reformat 
      it. 
 
  "M" sends the message as Easyplex (Email) by using the MA command 
 
  "Y" is the same as M, but tells CIS not to reformat. 
 
  "?" displays the forum's section names 
 
    Other  options  may  be  displayed  at  this  point,  depending  on  CIS 
    requirements and whether you are using W>rite, U>ser address, J>oin,  or 
    R>eply.  These include  prompts for the  addressee's User ID  (PPN), and 
    the Section  number.  Simply  follow the  prompts to  finish storing the 
    message. 
 
    There is one additional powerful  feature that's been added to  ATO that 
    allows you  to recall  SIG sub-topic  names.  If  you've used  the Alt-G 
    "gather" function in terminal mode you may simply enter a question  mark 
    when prompted for the sub-topic  name and they will be  displayed.  This 
    feature applies  when you  have used  the W  - Write  new message or the 
    UA/Join command.

XI.  Errors and Reporting Problems 
______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Internal Errors 

 
    If an error occurs during execution,  a message is displayed on the  top 
    line of the display, such as ERROR 52 in LINE 1020. 
 
    The  message  contains  an  error  code  which is described in the BASIC 
    manual, and the line number where the problem occurred. 
 
    If you can't resolve the problem,  make a note of the error  message and 
    give the information to one of the authors. 
 
    After  the  error,  the  Function  Menu  is displayed.  Depending on the 
    problem, you may decide to continue or terminate.  Any files created  by 
    ATO are left on the current drive.  Thus, you may restart processing  at 
    a later time. 
 
    By far the most common problem is a lack of response by AUTOSIG when  it 
    receives  the  SIG  "Function"  prompt.   Rather than giving the command 
    based upon your menu selection it just sits there. 
 
    The problem  is more  than likely  due to  an inconsistency  between the 
    prompt character that's been defined in  the SIG OPtion area and the  ^G 
    that ATO uses. 
 
    If you are using a computer  that may not be IBM compatible,  the screen 
    displays may be empty.  This is due to the way ATO places data  directly 
    into the monitor's display buffer.  The /T command-line parameter can be 
    used to force ATO to write to the display without using the IBM-specific 
    display buffer addresses.  See page 7-8 for further information on  this 
    parameter, and others that can help resolve compatibility problems. 
 
    Remember  that  the  default  ATO  prompt  character  is a Ctrl-G (Bell) 
    character.  This must be entered in the SIG OPtion area as ^G (the ^ key 
    is the shifted 6 key).  The CIS OPtion program will not accept CTRL-G as 
    a valid prompt character. 
 
    Be sure to keep a backup  copy of your AUTOSIG.DFN file.  Many  problems 
    can be solved by using a "good" DFN file, or by recreating it.   You can 
    force ATO to update the DFN file by using the Alt-N command.

XI.  Errors and Reporting Problems 
______________________________________________________________________________

 B. Trouble Shooting 

 
    AUTOSIG traps  and recovers  from all  possible errors  that the authors 
    have identified.  There are only two occasions when you're likely to see 
    any indication of an error. 
 
    The first  is if  you see  ASCII 243  on your  screen (the  mathematical 
    symbol  for  "less  than  or  equal  to").   This indicates that ATO has 
    trapped an error at the modem.   This is likely to happen once  or twice 
    both logging on and  logging off, and is  not a problem.  If  it happens 
    repeatedly elsewhere, check  your modem and  the wires connecting  it to 
    the PC. 
 
    The second is if you didn't let ATO run its full course and broke out of 
    the program or  turned your computer  off before returning  to DOS. This 
    will not harm your computer, but  it may leave some stray files  behind. 
    No corrective action is needed, except to always try to let ATO run  its 
    full course, from  DOS to execution  and back to  DOS. Since ATO  has so 
    many files open  it's a good  idea to do  a CHKDSK to  identify any lost 
    clusters.   This  action  will  probably  result  in  your "high message 
    number" being  corrupted if  you usee  on of  the AUTOSIG functions that 
    maintains and depends on that number. 
 
    Other than these two problems, if  you see a message in the  upper right 
    corner of your display indicating "Error nn at Line nnnnn", please leave 
    a message  the IBM  Communications Forum  (IBMCOM).  One  of the authors 
    will respond. 
 
    If you're having problems with ATO's display, this is probably caused by 
    incompatibility between your computer and some of the ATO code, which is 
    IBM-PC specific.  Although  ATO runs fine  "as is" on  most compatibles, 
    there are several "switches" that can get around compatibility problems. 
    See the section on Switches. 
 
    There are other problems that can arise when CompuServe is acting up and 
    sends something ATO doesn't expect.   Again, most of these problems  are 
    trapped and fixed automatically, but, given the large number of possible 
    miscues that CIS can generate, not  all can be fixed.  Here are  some of 
    the possible ones:

XI.  Errors and Reporting Problems 
______________________________________________________________________________

 C. Problem symptoms and solutions 

  ATO FREEZES; NO ACTION AT ALL 
 
    Make sure that you have set your SIG prompt character at ^G,  especially 
    if this happens at the Function: prompt.  Otherwise: 
 
    Wait a full minute.  The problem could be that CIS is busy.  If there is 
    still no sign of activity, hit <ESCape> twice followed by CTRL-C.   This 
    should put you  into direct contact  with CIS at  a menu that  gives you 
    several options, including Logoff.  Select that one and try again later. 
 
  MESSAGE SENT TO WRONG SIG 
 
    This  can  happen  using  AUTO  on  a  very  noisy phone line.  What has 
    happened is that CIS  sent a false signal  causing ATO to think  that it 
    had  moved  on  to  another  SIG.  This  error  never  happens on a good 
    connection.  There's no way ATO can fix it.  FEEDBACK to CIS might help. 
 
  FILES BUSY (Code xxnn) ... 
 
    This is a CIS message  that, unfortunately, gives you only  two choices: 
    wait it out or pull the plug.  None of this is unique to ATO; you'd have 
    the same problem if you logged  on manually.  If you choose to  pull the 
    plug, hit <ESCape><ESC>, which will return you to the ATO menu with  the 
    message that the "PC is CONNECTED".   Hit "Z".  This will send "OFF"  to 
    CIS and disconnect the modem.  Once CIS recognizes your action, it  will 
    log you off. 
 
  {{ Characters 
 
    This symbol is  encountered when there  is a lot  of noise on  the line. 
    Your best bet  is to abort  ATO as quickly  as possible if  you see this 
    symbol repeatedly. 
 
  EASYPLEX problems 
 
    You can name the EasyPlex "SIG"  whatever you like, as long as  the name 
    contains "MAIL", "Mail" or "mail". 
 
    Although ATO makes EasyPlex  look and act like  a SIG, when you  leave a 
    message,  you  are  actually  doing  a  file  transfer,  rather  than  a 
    line-by-line dump.  Your parity MUST be set at "zero" or "none".  To fix 
    this, G TERMINAL and reset  parity.  CIS keeps different parameters  for 
    you at 300 and  1200 baud, so make  sure that you're online  at the same 
    baud  rate  at  which  you  normally  use ATO. The other likely EasyPlex 
    problem is  if you  haven't inserted  your name  in the EasyPlex address 
    file.  Check the EasyPlex section for more information. 
 
  Message you sent arrives To: and From: YOU 
 
    ATO tries in several different ways to recover from inability to send  a 
    reply to a  message.  As a  last resort, ATO  will send your  message to 
    you.  If it looks like you're talking to yourself, it simply means  that

 C. Problem symptoms and solutions 

    ATO and CIS couldn't find any other way to deliver the message. 
 
 
  % NTWCPR - ... 
  % NTWJRP - Job Rec.... 
 
    ATO will wait  out most CIS  problems and resume  faultlessly.  However, 
    there is one situation (a CIS  failure followed by a recovery) when  CIS 
    asks you to send a CTRL-Q.  If  you do this manually at the CIS  prompt, 
    ATO will  recover as  well.  If  you don't,  CIS will  disconnect you in 
    about two minutes and ATO will return to the main menu. 
 
  ATO fails sending a P)rivate message 
 
    Some Sysops  have chosen  not to  permit (P)rivate  messages.  Since ATO 
    cannot possibly keep  up to date  on what options  are available on  the 
    various SIGs,  it's up  to you  to know  whether you  can send a private 
    message on a given SIG. If in doubt, send it public (using 'S' or  'U'), 
    check first with the Sysop, or  try it 'manually' before trying it  with 
    ATO. 
 
  ATO hangs up or aborts a file transfer 
 
    File transfers  can fail  for any  number of  reasons, including so much 
    line noise that CIS simply aborts.  By watching the NAK and ENQ  values, 
    you  can  get  an  idea  of  how  smoothly a transfer is proceeding.  An 
    excessively high NAK  value indicates that  the line connection  is poor 
    and you  should probably  log off  and call  back.  It  may help  to try 
    another phone number, or lower the baud rate.  In any event, report your 
    problems to FEEDBACK and they may credit your account for the time lost.

______________________________________________________________________________

 
    AUTOSIG was inspired by a program called SUPER.SIG in DL1 on the  TRS100 
    SIG which was  written by Howard  Benner.  The first  version of AUTOSIG 
    was written entirely by Vernon Buerg to save on his monthly bills. 
 
    This first version  was further expanded  and modified by  Vernon Buerg, 
    Frank Lipschutz and others as part of the what was then the INF  Project 
    Group established by  Don Watkins, SYSOP  of IBMNET.  A  sister program, 
    ACLS, was written by Tom Neff. 
 
    Some  earlier  versions  of  Autosig  were  supplied  with  the  source, 
    uncompiled Basic  code.  Because  of dozens  of features  that have been 
    added,  the  bulk  of  which  are  in  assembler,  source  is  no longer 
    available. 
 
    A very  special thanks  to those  who helped  test the  numerous interim 
    versions of ATO.  Space limits individual  thanks, but without  them ATO 
    would not be where it is today.

 A. Quick Reference Words 

 
    This is a fairly complete list of forums and their quick reference words 
    as of January, 198*.  Please note that the list is growing very  quickly 
    and for up to minute reference you may: 
 
         1)  GO INDEX and search there, or 
         2)  type FIND [subject] from your favorite !  prompt. 
 
    Additionally you'll find that On-Line Today magazine usually contains an 
    updated forum listing every other issue or so. 
 
    In most cases only  the first six characters  of a quick reference  word 
    are needed;  i.e.  DDJFOR  works the  same as  DDJFORUM.

 B. Command Line Options 

 
    You may supply one  or more command line  options to change the  default 
    operation of ATO. Each switch  must begin with the slash  "/" character. 
    The letter may be in upper or lower case. For example, 
 
                AUTOSIG /1/Q/F 
 
 
    Here is a summary of the option switches and their effects: 
 
   /B    tells ATO not to accept input from the keyboard during AUTO 
   /C    causes the screen to be cleared before a message is displayed 
   /F    disable sending a form feed to the printer when printing messages 
   /H    indicates that your monitor  does not require retrace testing 
   /I    tells ATO that a mouse is available for input in the Primary Menu 
   /J    changes the messages editor's input mode to insert 
   /K    sets the Email message disposition to Keep 
   /M    tells ATO to send an RM (Read Marked) when appropriate 
   /N    tells ATO not to prompt when you exit with ctrl-D 
   /P    causes a ^P to be sent upon entry to a forum 
   /Q    turns off the speaker for quiet opertion 
   /S    forces a sort of the Quick Scan headers by the Mark function 
   /T    tells ATO to use normal BIOS routines for displaying to the screen 
   /V    tells ATO to print error messages; this is a debugging tool only 
 
   /1    invokes the AUTO first pass immediately 
   /2    invokes the AUTO second pass immediately 
 
   /Xf   supplies the name of a script file 'f' to be execute as soon as the 
         logon has completed,  e.g.  /XDL  would run the file called DL.SCR. 
         This is handy for doing automatic file transfers. 
 
   /Gx   supplies a new prompt character, where 'x' is a letter; for example 
 
                AUTOSIG /GI 
 
         results  in  ATO  using  the  control-H  character (backspace) as a 
         prompt rather than the default control-G (BEL) character.
