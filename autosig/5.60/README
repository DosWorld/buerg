          The other file in this ARC is a simple starting point to using ATO
          within DESQview (either 2.00 or 2.01).  To use this setup file:

          1.   Transfer it to the directory containing your ATO executable
               program. 

          2.   From within DV, open the Add Program (AP) window, specify O
               (for Other), enter the path to your ATO program, and press
               <enter>.

          3.   You should be presented with a menu which includes (probably
               as the only entry) the choice "CompuServe".  Move the cursor
               down to it, press <space>, then <enter>.

          4.   Press <enter> once more to indicate you are done adding new
               programs.

          5.   Now open the Change Program (CP) window to change the AT
               window you just added.  
               a.   You will probably need to change the program name (which
                    I just left at ATO since I did not know which version
                    might be desired).  
               b.   I have the memory set at 300K.  Depending on version, you
                    can probably get by with 240K or even less.  
               c.   I also have the window set to open up full screen.  If
                    you want it to only occupy part of the screen, use F1 to
                    go to the advanced options screen and blank out the
                    entries in the Starting Height and Starting Width boxes.

          You should be ready to go now.

          Thanks are due to Dave Hoagland for pointing out the easier way to
          install a transferred .DVP file in DESQview.
