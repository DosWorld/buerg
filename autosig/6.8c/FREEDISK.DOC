                        SAVE YOURSELF SOME TROUBLE:

Many shareware programs can be registered directly through PSL (check the
program's documentation), in which case you do not have to send this form
to the author nor to us.

                           Terms and Conditions:

1. You may make and use as many copies of this form as you wish, but only one
      free-disk form may be redeemed per order. The other offers are good
      for first-time ordering or annual renewals/editions only.

2. The signed form is non-transferable and has no cash value.

3. Shipping and handling must be paid on all orders. If you order only a
      free disk, the shipping charge is $4. Coupons and orders sent
      without payment will not be processed.

4. Program(s) on the free disk may also require shareware registration
      payment(s) - the word "free" refers only to our software library fees.

5. This offer may be canceled or modified by PsL at any time. For latest
      details, call PsL at 713-524-6394.

6. The CD-ROM offer is an introductory offer for people who have not
      purchased a PsL Monthly CD before.

NOTE: If the programmer cashes your check but does not return this form to you,
you may send us a copy of BOTH sides of the canceled check instead of this form.
