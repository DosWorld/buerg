   AUTOSIG Setup Script                                       March 27, 1990


   You can readily see that there are a number of parameters which must
   be set in your CompuServe account before you and AUTOSIG can be a
   productive team, together.  Without taking the time to learn all about
   the automated world of script processing, you can go right ahead and
   use one that we've provided for you to set parameters in your favorite
   forums.  It's called SETUP.SCR, and is included with the program.

   After setting your host options and defining your forums, run the
   SETUP script on each of your forums in the following steps:

   1.  Select the first forum from the Main Menu.

   2.  Press "G" to go online.

   3.  Once at the top of the forum, read the screens until you are asked
       to "J"oin the forum.  Join, then enter your name and PPN.

   4.  Once at the "Enter choice !" prompt, press Alt-T to run a script.
       In the script name prompt block, type "setup".  Press return, and
       watch the magic happen!

   5.  At the "Forum !" prompt, press Alt-G.  This tells ATO to gather
       the names of the message sections.  You can use this information
       when you leave messages and need to know which section to use.

   6.  At the "forum !" prompt again, press Ctrl-X.  This puts ATO back
       at the Forum function menu.

   7.  Select your next forum using the left or right arrow keys.

   8.  Repeat steps 2 through 7 for each forum you wish to use.
