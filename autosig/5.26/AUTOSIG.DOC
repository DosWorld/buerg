I. Introduction



	AUTOSIG is a program written specifically for CompuServe Special
	Interest  Group  access.   It  provides  an  automatic	way   of
	processing SIG messages that is quick and economical.

	AUTOSIG is  a FREE  communications program  written with   Quick
	Basic  and  assembly  language.  It  is provided as a executable
	(.EXE)	program  for  the  IBM	PC.  It is fully compatible with
	Compaq	computers,  the  Tandy	1000  and  1200,  and most other
	clones.  In addition to its main purpose of offloading messages,
	it is a terminal program which can be used to access other areas
	of CompuServe  and download  from the  Data Libraries  using "B"
	protocol.

	AUTOSIG was inspired by a program called SUPER.SIG in DL1 on the
	TRS100 SIG which was written by Howard Benner [70235,1337].  The
	first version of  AUTOSIG was written  entirely by Vernon  Buerg
	[70007,1212] as a way to cut down on his monthly bills.

	This first version was	further expanded and modified  by Vernon
	Buerg, Frank  Lipschutz and  others as	part of  the INF Project
	Group established  by Don  Watkins, Sysop  of IBMNET.	A sister
	program, ACLS was written by Tom Neff.

	The major features of AUTOSIG (ATO) are:

	      - automatic dialing and access to CompuServe (CIS)
		through local, Tymnet, or Telenet nodes

	      - automatic downloading of SIG messages and bulletins

	      - automatic retrieval and transmission of Email messages
		and EasyPlex binary files

	      - file transfer, upload and download, using CIS "B"
		error checking protocol

	      - user defined program Function keys

	      - full screen editor for composing messages offline

	      - automatic transmission of your messages using the SED or
		EDIT editor options

	      - split screen mode for CB use and conferencing (CO)

	      - offline display, printing, and saving of SIG messages

I. Introduction



		 A word or two about the Deeper meanings of ATO
		 ----------------------------------------------

		ATO - To go on-line (from the Hayes command set)

	ATO is to my thinking a community hack in the true sense of  the
	word, that is, lots of people contributing time and effort  just
	for the sheer  joy (?) of  programming and 'bumming'  code.  For
	instance I did the first version of the full screen editor,  and
	before I knew it, Vern had made the sucker *nice* as well as cut
	the amount of code in half.  Frank would come along and  perform
	a function  in one  instruction that  had previously  taken two.
	Hacking at its best and perhaps the way it should be.

	The latest version incorporates a  total rewrite of ATO by  Vern
	Buerg but to  additional features he  has added the  majority of
	while are written in assembler.   It is indeed a tribute  to his
	talents and contributions  to the PC  community.  On a	personal
	note I must say  that Vern is one  of the best programmers  I've
	had the pleasure of knowing.  He is truly an example of what the
	computing fraternity is all about.

	ATO is now over 3 years old so perhaps it's a good time to  talk
	about the original design goals:

	 - Make it reasonably easy to use (although with function
	   comes complexity)
	 - Don't compete with any commercial programs.
	 - ATO is free and is not to be shareware (not that I have
	   anything against shareware, but ATO belongs to the forum
	   community).

	ATO is not  meant to be  1) the best  all purpose communications
	program in the	world, 2) the  most flexible or  3) the fastest.
	No doubt  there will  always be  raging debates  over the "best"
	communications program.   ATO makes  no such  claims.  ATO  DOES
	represent a lot of work by  a lot of people that expect  nothing
	in return other than the hope that you enjoy the fruit of  their
	efforts.  Isn't  that nice?   Perhaps you  feel that  it's worth
	paying for.  If so  send some money to	a charity and feel  good
	about it.

	If you feel a program that allows little flexibility for you  to
	change how  things are	done we  encourage to  try out	the many
	programs on the market	that allow user written  scripts.  There
	are some excellent user supported and commercial programs on the
	market and you may find you enjoy "rolling your own".

II. Installation

  Getting started


   Check-off List


	    Refer to this manual to perform the following steps:



	      _____  1. Install the ATO files on your disk

	      _____  2. Set your CIS Forum Options

	      _____  3. Set your CIS Terminal Options

	      _____  4. Set your modem's switches

II. Installation

  Getting started


   Setting CIS Forum Options

	Like any new  program you'll (hopefully)  be anxious to  run ATO
	right out of  the box, but  before running AUTOSIG,  certain SIG
	options must be in  effect.  ATO depends upon  certain sequences
	of events and control characters and if those aren't set  you'll
	run into problems.

	Don't be put off by the size of this manual!  Most parts of  ATO
	are fairly intutive  and you'll not  need to memorize  the whole
	thing.	You will get some  benefits by just scanning the  manual
	so if you should have  a problem perhaps you'll recall  that you
	saw a mention of the condition in the manual and can then  refer
	back.

	So first  you'll want  to figure  out which  forums you  want to
	visit and then log on  with whatever program you used  to obtain
	AUTOSIG.  Don't logon with AUTOSIG until these options have been
	set as it'll just get more confusing than it needs to be.

	So you're now logged on at your "normal" baud rate (normal being
	what you'll be using with AUTOSIG) and go to the first forum  on
	your list.  At the Function: prompt  or top menu type OP to  set
	these options:


		 MENU	- if currently in Menu mode, select Command mode
			  (Set Use menus to NO)

		 PC ^G	- set prompt character to control-G (bell),  you
			  may use other prompt characters, but will have
			  to  change  the  ATO PC Options,  or	supply a
			  start-up command switch

		 TM	- Type waiting messages [NO]

	Hit  enter  to	exit  the  OPtion  area  and  make  the  changes
	permanent.

	Now go to the next forum  in your list and set the  same options
	there.


AUTOSIG User's Manual                                         Page 5


II. Installation

  Getting started

	The prompt character is ^G (control-G), the bell character.  You
	will not hear the bell while AUTOSIG is running, but will during
	other  sessions  using	other  communications programs.  You may
	change the prompt characters during non-AUTOSIG sessions, but do
	be sure and  change it back  before running ATOSIG  again.  G is
	set by using Shift-6, and not CTRL, for the "^" character.  Most
	communications program	have a	"filter" or  "strip and convert"
	option so you may be able to convert a "7" (BELL) to a "0" (NUL)
	when using other communications programs.

	ATO doesn't care if you have your default editor defined as EDIT
	or  SED  (EDIT	doesn't  have  line  numbers  whereas SED does).
	Uploading  messages  to  EDIT  is  a  bit faster, but if you use
	interactive mode and feel comfortable with SED by all means keep
	it as your default editor!  ATO  trys hard to let you have  your
	parameters  set  the  way  YOU	want  then and not the other way
	around.

	Other  SIG  options  (non-stop	messages,  etc.) are set for you
	temporarily by ATO each time you access a SIG.


AUTOSIG User's Manual                                         Page 6


II. Installation

  Getting started


   Setting CIS Terminal Options

	You MUST make the following change to your CompuServe Parameters
	in order for ATO to work properly.

	IMPORTANT: Any changes to CIS  terminal options must be made  at
	the same baud rate at which you use AUTOSIG.  CIS maintains  two
	sets of parameters for your user  id -- one at 300 baud  one for
	1200 baud and yet another for 2400 baud.

	The speed you're running  with when you make  changes determines
	whether they  become part  of your  2400, 1200	or your 300 baud
	options.


   Change CIS Terminal Settings

	So now your forum options have been set in the forums you'll  be
	visiting  using  AUTOSIG  so  now  you	need  to set your global
	options.  From any ! prompt  enter GO TERMINAL.  This takes  you
	to  the  DEFALT  area.	 You'll  be presented with the following
	menus (more or	less, the DEFALT  menus may change  from time to
	time):


	   CompuServe		 Terminal

	   1 Instructions
	   2 Setting Your Terminal Type
	   3 Setting Your Logon Actions
	   4 Setting Delays for Printers
	   5 View or Change Current
	       Terminal Parameters
	   6 Setting your Service Options
	   Last Menu Page.  Key digit
	   or M for previous menu.

II. Installation

  Getting started

	You'll get  a listing  of your  current terminal  settings which
	will look something like this:

	   Your Terminal Type:
	   Other
	   Baud Rate:  1200
	   Current Terminal Parameters:
	   1 Terminal width  80 CHARACTERS
	   2 Page size is now	  24 LINES
	   3 Form Feeds are	 SIMULATED
	   4 Horizontal Tabs are SIMULATED
	   5 Terminal Supports UPPER/LOWER
	   6 Caps Lock is	       OFF
	   7 Line Feeds are	      SENT
	   8 Parity is		      EVEN
	   9 Blank Lines are	      SENT
	  10  Inquire for VIDTEX is	ON

	  Select item to be changed or
	   press <ENTER> for no change.
	   ! 8		    <--------------- Select item 8 then <enter>.


AUTOSIG User's Manual                                         Page 8


II. Installation

  Getting started

	You should see the following list of possible choices:

	   1 Parity is Zero
	   2 Parity is Even
	   3 Parity is Odd
	   4 Parity is One
	   Current setting is 1
	   <ENTER> leaves it unchanged

	You should get back the earlier menu with "Your terminal  type".
	Just press <Enter>, but first make note of your current terminal
	type.  If it is "Vidtex", you'll be fine.  If want to change  it
	to "CRT"  to avoid  receiving Vidtex's  code in  AUTOSIG or  any
	other non-Vidtex  communications program.   If you  elect to use
	CRT or	"Other" as  your terminal  type you'll  need to make one
	additional change.  Select entry #10 ("Inquire for VIDTEX")  and
	set it to OFF. This is an important switch!!  Once you set  your
	parameters and after you press <enter>, you'll get the main menu
	back:

	   1 Instructions
	   2 Setting Your Terminal Type
	   3 Setting Your Logon Actions
	   4 Setting Delays for Printers
	   5 View or Change Current
	       Terminal Parameters
	   6 Set your Service Options
	   Last Menu Page.  Key digit
	   or M for previous menu.
	   ! 2		    <----------------- Select item 2 then <enter>

	If you selected 2, follow the menu to change your terminal  type
	to "CRT", press <enter>, and you'll be back at the menu above.

	   You'll be presented with two choices:

	   1 Make all changes effective
	     for future sessions
	   2 Changes effective for this
	     session only
	   <ENTER> makes changes effective
	   for this session only.
	   Key Choice: 1     <---------------- Select item 1 then <enter>.

	Our experience is  that setting parity	to ZERO will  not affect
	the operation of any other communications programs you might  be
	running; if it does please let me know.

  Getting started


   Set Modem Switches

	ATO has  the facility  to accept  any modem  commands and, thus,
	support  for  many  modems  has  been  added.  If you're using a
	non Hayes modem you'll need to study your manual very  carefully
	to determine the needed modem parameters.

	The ATO crew has  access to a limited  number of modem types  so
	any tip or hints  you have for using  ATO on a certain	modem is
	very welcomed.

	On Hayes  modems the  setting of  the DTR  (Data Terminal Ready)
	switch will determine whether  or not the modem  is disconnected
	when ATO is exited.   With the switch ON  (or UP), the modem  is
	disconnected.

	The following modem switch settings (for a Hayes SmartModem) are
	recommended (but not absolutely necessary):

	  1 - DOWN	Modem remains connected after ATO is terminated.
	      UP	Modem disconnects when ATO is exited.

	  2 - UP    V1	Modem sends result codes in English.

	  3 - DOWN  Q0	Result codes are sent to the terminal.

	  4 - UP    E1	Modem echos characters while in command mode.

	  5 - DOWN	Modem will not answer phone.

	  6 - UP	Enables Carrier Detect sensing.

III. Operation

  Overview

	ATO is	a menu	driven program.   That is,  ATO presents you you
	with a series of menus from which you choose the action that you
	want performed.

	The first menu is the Primary Menu.  From it, you proceed to the
	main Function Menu and to the Forum, Host and PC options menus.

	At any given time, ATO is in one of several possible "modes"  of
	operation.  These are the Menu mode, Offline mode, Online  mode,
	and the Terminal mode.


   ATO File Names

	In addition to he program file,  ATO  requires that a definition
	file be present.  This definition  file  (AUTOSIG.DFN)	contains
	information about the host systems  that  you  call,  about  the
	forums that you visit,	and about the computer that you use.  If
	there is no DFN file, ATO will create one for you.

	Other files are created by  ATO depending on the functions  that
	are performed.	Some of these  are temporary files, such as  the
	editor's work file; and others are meant to be kept, such as the
	files  containing  downloaded  messages.   In  most cases, empty
	files are  deleted at  program termination.   The PPN  processor
	uses a file name of the form "signame.PPN", or a file name  that
	you supply.

	Each file has a name in this format:  sigX.ATO - where "sig" is
	the name of the DFN being used, X is a one letter file function
	code, and the file extension is always .ATO.  For example, file
	IBMCOML.ATO is created for the (W) function with the IBMCOM SIG
	configuration.

	H - message headers, from functions Q and H.

	M - downloaded messages, from functions F, T, R, U, I, A, and Y.

	L - original messages, from function (W), or from the <R>eply
	    option while reading messages offline.

	S - SAVEd messages, a permanent message file from the <S>ave
	    option while reading messages offline.

	R - temporary file created for downloading messages

III. Operation

  Starting the Program


	Once  you  have  your  Forum  OPtions  set  up	and  your global
	CompuServe TERMINAL defaults set, you are ready to go!

	You start  ATO by  invoking it	with a	DOS command.  A compiled
	version of the program	is supplied (AUTOSIG.EXE) for  execution
	by  DOS.  At  the  DOS	prompt,  enter	the  name of the AUTOSIG
	program:

			    A>AUTOSIG

	DOS now loads the program and begins its execution.  You  should
	be presented with  the ATO Primary  Menu screen.  If  nothing is
	displayed, your computer may not be compatible with the way  the
	your PC manages the monitor display.  You should then press  the
	F10 key to tell ATO to terminate and return to the DOS. You then
	restart ATO by	adding the characters  /T to the  start command.
	This tells  ATO to  use a  different method  of writing  to your
	monitor, for example:

			    A>AUTOSIG /T

	(These are advanced features that are not needed unless you have
	compatibility problems with  your computer, or	you have ATO  up
	and running and want to explore additional features.)

	Many  ATO  options  can   be  specified  before  you   load  the
	AUTOSIG.EXE program  by adding	a space,  "/", and  a letter  to
	specify the option, e.g.: AUTOSIG /T /B /C.  The letters may  be
	in upper or lower case.

	Some of these "switches" can fix incompatibility problems, while
	others bypass menus or customize the program for you.  Following
	are the switches currently available:

	/B locks the keyboard during auto functions.  This allows you to
	   supply ATO console input through a batch file system or use a
	   utility such as KEYFAKE or KEYIN to control ATO.

	/C clears the screen when full, preventing scrolling.  Useful if
	   your color monitor flickers while  lines roll on and off  the
	   screen.


	/F Eliminates  most  form  feeds  issued   when  P>rinting   SIG
	   messages.  This switch forces a continuous printout from  the
	   time you enter  ATO from DOS  until the time  you exit.  Your
	   messages will be printed continuously with form feeds  issued
	   only as the printer nears the perforation or end of the page.
	   If you issue a LF or FF directly to your printer, ATO's  line
	   counter will get out of synch.

	/G Allows you to  re-specify the prompt character.   The default
	   is ^G (GG on the command line), i.e. the BEL character.

	/H Disables testing of	the monitor's retrace.  This  results in
	   faster  displays,  but  may	cause  flicker on some monitors.
	   This  options  does	not  apply  to	the  use  of  monochrome
	   monitors.

	/I Allows using a Mouse as an Input device at the Primary Menu.

	/K Keep  (SAVE)  Easyplex  messages  instead of using DELETE to
	   DELETE them.

III. Operation

  Start-up Switches

	/M Feature used for [R]ead [M]arked function.  Used as follows:

	     /M and ^P=Y  = RM always sent whenever entering a SIG.
	     /M and ^P=N  = RM sent only if "You have... messages"
	     no /M, ^P=Y  = RM sent after first "Function:" prompt for Q
			       only.
	     no /M, ^P=N  = RM sent only if "You have ... messages"


	/P Causes ATO to send a CTRL-P when logging on, and at the start
	   of each SIG. This overrides whatever you have set in your ATO
	   O>ption menu.  It bypasses all CIS opening announcements, SIG
	   messages,  announcements  of  waiting  messages  and  waiting
	   Email.   Much  faster,  but	at  the  risk  that you may miss
	   something important.

	/Q selects Quiet mode; most of the beeps and bells are disabled

	/S instructs ATO to  automatically sort the QS	headers whenever
	   the Mark command is used

	/T eliminates  an   assembly  language	routine that ATO uses to
	   address the video memory  directly.	If you're using  a clone
	   and your screen blanks unexpectedly, try this switch.

	   ATO is compatible  with DesqView, Double  DOS, and APX  Core.
	   You need not use the /T unless you have problems, i.e.  blank
	   or missing displays.

	/V Debugging option to print errors.  Printer must be on-line.


	d: allows  you to  specify a  drive, other  than the drive where
	   AUTOSIG is stored, for your configuration and log files.

	   Adding, for example, "C:" (no "/"), makes ATO look to the  C:
	   drive for DFN and LOG files.  See the RAMDISK section for one
	   way to use this option (Appendix V).

	   Optionally, you may set an environment variable called ATO to
	   define the drive and path for all ATO files.  For example,

			  SET ATO=C:\CISFILES

	   would  instruct  ATO  to  find  its	file  on drive C, in the
	   directory called CISFILES.	The individual Forum  path names
	   over-ride this value.  This variable is supplied to allow you
	   to tell ATO where to find its DFN and "log" files.

III. Operation

  Start-up Switches

	/1 (slash one) is the equivalent of selecting "(Z) /1" from  the
	   SIG menu to activate the first pass of the AUTO function

	/2 is  the equivalent  of F2  Primary menu  key to  activate the
	   second pass of the AUTO function.

	Don't worry about all of  these switches!!  They can be  used to
	modify the way ATO works, but you don't need to worry about  any
	of them until  you really get  your feet wet  with ATO and  then
	perhaps not even then.	Also, most of the options can be changed
	by invoking the PC Options Menu.  Just keep them in mind as  you
	get more comfortable with ATO and you might find a use for them.

	These switches can be combined in any order that suits your  way
	of using ATO. For example, a  command that might be used with  a
	RAMDISK is:

			  AUTOSIG /p /f C:

	This tells ATO	that, although AUTOSIG.EXE  is on drive  A:, the
	DFN and  LOG files  are on  drive C:;  that opening  CIS and SIG
	bulletins should be bypassed, regardless of how the ^P option is
	set; and that the printer  should issue form feeds only  when it
	nears the end of a page -- not at the top of each SIG.

III. Operation

  Primary Menu


	The  Primary Menu is displayed when ATO is started.  It consists
	of the	Host Selection	menu,  the Item Selection menu,  and the
	Forum Selection List.  Refer to figure 1.

	The  Host menu	offers a choice of  CompuServe services to call.
	The Forum menu offers a choice of  Communications Forums  (SIGs)
	to  access.  The  Item	menu  selects  the operation to perform.

	For the first use of ATO, you should:

	  - edit the PC Options entries to set the display colors and
	    other hardware related items; use the ESCape key.

	  - edit the Host entries to supply your  userid, password, the
	    CIS phone number, and other service items; use the F4 key.

	  - edit the  Forum  entries  to identify the forum(s) that you
	    wish to access; use the F3 key.


    Primary Menu keys

	-  <enter> selects the Item that is highlighted (the Item bar)
	-  ESCape selects the PC Options Menu for viewing and editing
	-  F- function keys perform the operation described in the Item list
	-  Numbers select a Host
	-  Letters (A through X) select a Forum
	-  the letter Z highlights all forums which have "work", i.e. files
	-  TAB moves the Item bar to the next item
	-  shift+TAB moves the Item bar to the previous item
	-  PgDn or PgUp selects the next Forum and moves the mark
	-  the up or down arrow selects the next Host and moves the mark

III. Operation

  PC Options Menu


	Pressing  the  ESCape  key,  or  positioning  the  Item  bar  to
	"Reconfigure PC"  selects the  PC Options  Menu for  viewing and
	editing.  The middle section of the Primary Menu (the Item menu)
	becomes the  PC Options  Menu.	Refer  to figure  2 for a sample
	display of the menu.


    "Normal COLOR f,b"

	This  allows  you  to  set  the  colors  to  be used for the "f"
	foreground and "b" background for non-highlighted areas.   Refer
	to the BASIC manual COLOR command for a list of valid numbers.

	Note:  7,0 may provide a better display on a monochrome monitor.
	---------------------------------------------------------------

    "Hilite COLOR f,b"

	This  setting  allows  you  to	set  the  color  to  be used for
	high-lighted messages and fields.  Refer to the BASIC manual for
	a list of valid codes.

	Note:  15,0 may be better for a monochrome monitor.
	--------------------------------------------------

	The new color settings take effect when you exit the PC  Options
	menu and return to the Primary menu.

    "Logon ^P"

	Enter a  Y to  have ATO  send a  ^P to	CIS at logon time.  This
	bypasses the initial CIS messages and menu.  If you boot AUTOSIG
	using " /P", this setting  is irrelevant.  With /P, the  program
	will send a ^P at logon and at the start of each SIG,  bypassing
	all announcements.   Bypassing announcements  may mean	you miss
	important information (like new versions of AUTOSIG).


	Each of the slash-letter items	are the same as those  described
	for  the  command  line  switches.   The  command  line   values
	over-ride the PC Options values unless you change them here.

	If you have used AUTOSIG in a prior version please be aware that
	the structure of  the configuration file  has changed and  a new
	DFN file is now required.   The previous DFN file can  no longer
	be used.

III. Operation

  Forum Options Menu


    Forum Selection
	The Forum Selection list contains three standard forum	entries,
	Email, IbmCOM, and IbmNew.  None of them is required, but if you
	intend to access Easyplex, you	must have a forum with	the name
	EMAIL.

	To select a forum, enter the letter shown next to its name.   If
	you want to access a new forum, select the F5 Add a Forum  item.
	You are then presented with the Forum Options menu.  Fill in the
	menu items with the new information as desrired.

	For example, on the initial Primary Menu, the next forum  letter
	would be "D".   The defaults for  each new Forum  are taken from
	the previous forum  entry, or from  the "C" forum  in this case.
	You can  change forum  options later  by using	the (O) function
	from the main Function menu.

	You may  also use  the PgDn  and PgUp  keys to	change the forum
	selection.  The >> mark moves next to the selected forum's name.
	The forum is  not actually changed  until ATO sends  a "Go page"
	command to CIS. This is done when you select a command from  the
	Function menu.


    Forum Information

	Information is required  for each SIG  Forum to be  accessed.  A
	Forum Options menu  is presented by  selecting item F3	from the
	Primary Menu, or when the (O) change Options function is  chosen
	from the  main Function  Menu.	The  menu consists  of a list of
	questions.  Answer each question appropriately.  If no change is
	required, press ENTER.	If no more questions are to be answered,
	press  ESCAPE.	 The  information  is  required  for  performing
	dialing and logging on.


    "SIG name"

	Enter a name of up to SEVEN characters.  This name is  displayed
	on the Function Menu.  Since this name is used to create  files,
	be sure that  it contains valid  DOS filename characters.   That
	is, do not use * (asterisk), ?	(question mark), or .  (period).
	ATO will  shorten the  SIG name  to seven  characters should you
	enter more.

    "GO to page "

III. Operation

  Forum Options Menu


	Enter the  CIS page  number to	go to  after an automatic logon,
	e.g.  IBMCOM.  Please see appendix  Q for a list of  forum names
	and their quick reference words.

    "Hostname override"

	If access  to a  Forum can  only be  made through one particular
	Host, then supply  the name of	that Host here.   For example, a
	Host called "CONFERENCE"  may be useful  for defining a  300 bps
	Host for CB or conferencing.


    "Files drive:\path"

	Tells ATO  which drive	and directory  to use  for access to its
	files.	If left blank, ATO will use the current directory on the
	current drive.	You may supply a drive, and/or a path name.  For
	example, C:\ATO.

	Except for the AUTOSIG.DFN file and the log (AUTOSIG.mth) files,
	all files are accessed from this drive and path.

    "Starting msg # or N "

	Normally N is used so that all New messages are processed.   But
	a message number can  be substituted.  This number  replaces the
	CIS High Message Number (HMN) and  is used by the QS, SF  and RF
	SIG-commands for the Q, H and F functions.

    "Append message file "

	Enter an  N to	re-use the  message file  whenever messages  are
	downloaded.  Enter  a Y  to accumulate	messages in  the message
	file.	If  you  do  enter  "Y",  please  watch  free disk space
	carefully, and use  the "K" option  from the main  menu to erase
	files when free space becomes short.

    "Log sessions"

	Enter a Y to  record on-line time in  a log file.  The	log file
	name  is  AUTOSIG.mmm,	where  'mmm'  is an abbreviation for the
	current month.	Enter an N to disable logging.

    "Stay connected "

	Enter  a  Y  if  you  wish  to	remain connected after a message
	upload/download  session.   If	you  want  to  go to another SIG
	during the current call this option should be set to Y. Enter an

	N to disconnect  from CIS after  exiting a SIG.  If you use  the
	"AUTO" option (see page 32), this setting in irrelevant.

    "Send forum ^P"

	Enter a Y to  instruct ATO to send  a ^P immediately after  a Go
	Page.	This  suppresses  all  CIS  messages  until  the   Forum
	"Function:" prompt is sent.


    "Sections (# or ALL)"

	Leave this blank if you intend to access all Forum sections,  or
	if you prefer to use the CIS Option command to set your  section
	access.  Otherwise, you  enter a list  of section numbers.   ATO
	will only access messages from those sections.	Refer to the CIS
	"SS" command for more information.

    "PPN file name"

	Enter the name of your user id address book, e.g.   AUTOSIG.PPN.
	If left blank, a filename of the form "signame.PPN" is used.


	Note: The Forum Options menu is exited by using the ESCAPE key.

III. Operation

  HOST Options Menu


	For each computer system that  you intend to call, a  HOST entry
	is required.  You must have  at least one HOST entry  completely
	defined.

	A host is simply a computer  system that ATO can access via  the
	telephone.  You are  probably using ATO  to call CompuServe  and
	access forums,	but ATO  can also  access special  CIS services,
	such as  Easyplex and  the Business  Information Service  (BIS).
	Except	for  Email,  you  probably  have  no need to worry about
	special host services.

    "HOST name"

	Identifies the system that you	are calling.  Enter a one  to 17
	character name.  You  may include blanks,  commas, or any  other
	characters.

    "CIS phone number"

	Enter your local CIS or net telephone number.  If you access CIS
	through TYMNET, prefix the number with a T, e.g.  T555-1212.  If
	you  use  TELENET,  prefix  the  number  with the letter G, e.g.
	G555-1212.   If  the  phone  number  is  too long to fit in this
	field, place the first part  of it in the Modem  Commands field.
	ATO sends both fields to the modem when dialing.


    "Your userid "

	Enter your  CIS numbers  separated by  a comma,  e.g. 70000,000.
	You may also combine your password with the userid by  following
	your userid with a backslash, and then with your password,  e.g.
	70000,000\mypassword.	This  results  in  skipping the password
	prompt from CIS,  and makes the  logon slightly faster	and less
	susceptible to line noise problems.


   "Your password "

	Enter your  CIS password.   (Special note.   Remember that  your
	password will now be on your diskette or hard disk and	remember
	to keep it secure.   Though it may be  a hassle, do change  your
	password on CIS periodically and go thru the routine of changing
	it in  your configuration  file; it's  worth the  extra time and
	trouble).

    "IPX/Tymnet address "

	If you are using Tymnet to  call CIS, you may enter the  name of
	the CIS host here.  The default is CIS02.


    "What baud rate "

	Enter the modem speed  to be used, normally  a value of 300,  or
	1200.  Other speeds may be specified but will work only if  your
	CIS node supports them such as 450 or 2400 baud.  The other  COM
	parameters are set automatically to 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and
	No parity.   ATO will  not change  the baud  rate while  you are
	connected.  You must  exit ATO, or  log off, to  change the baud
	rate.


    "Modem dial commands "

	Enter  an  appropriate	command  sequence  for	your modem.  The
	default commands are for the Hayes modem and should be retained.
	This field may also be used to extend the telephone number.  The
	default may contain "M0".  If  you want to hear the  handshaking
	between ATO and CIS, delete these two characters.


    "COMmunications port "

	Enter  either  COM1:,  COM2:,  COM3:  or  COM4: to specify which
	Asynchronous Communications Adapter (port)  is to be used.   The
	colon is  optional.  COM3  and COM4  are supported  in a limited
	manner.


    "Modem Connect text"

	Tells ATO  what your  modem sends  when the  phone is connected.
	The default is	"CONNECT".  ATO ignore  any data after  this, so
	that the text may connect a baud rate, e.g.  "CONNECT 2400"  and
	"CONNECT 1200" are the same.


    "Modem Disconnect text"

	Tells  ATO  what  your	modem  sends  when  the  phone	 becomes
	disconnected.  The default is "NO CARRIER".  ATO also checks for
	"BUSY" and "NO DIALTONE".

	The special character ~ (squiggle) may be used to have ATO pause

	Tells ATO what to send to the modem to rest it.  The default for
	Hayes-compatible modems  is "~+++~ATZ"  which results  in a  one
	second pause, sending three  plus signs characters, another  one
	second pause, and then the command ATZ.


    "Host 1st ready prompt"

	Tells ATO  what the  Host will	send when  it is  ready for your
	requests.  The default is "CompuServe".


    "Host 2nd ready message"

	This is used in addition  to the first ready prompt.   ATO waits
	for either of the 1st or 2nd ready messages.


    "Bulletin file name"

	This supplies the drive, path,	and filename that ATO is  to use
	for saving bulletins.  That is, ATO saves all logon messages  up
	until a Forum command is sent.

    "HOST connect response"

	This is the code that should  be sent when you are connected  to
	the HOST.  Typically this would be ^C for a direct CIS note.

	Important note for  2400 baud users:  Many CompuServe 2400  baud
	nodes use MNP and there is  a slight delay before the CIS  modem
	is ready to accept the ^C.  If this is the case, you may use the
	special  "wait"  character  (~)  to  delay sending the ^C.  E.g.
	~~~^C would cause a 3 second wait before sending the ^C.

IV. Main Function Menu

  Function Menu


	After the SIG  Forum has been  selected, you are  presented with
	the main Function menu.  Refer to Figure 5.

	The Forum name is the name  of the forum that you selected  from
	the Primary Menu.  You can change to another SIG, or define  and
	create a new one, by using option letter C(hange forums).

	After any SIG session a  "suggestion" letter will appear in  the
	"Select a letter" section  of the menu.  The  highlighted letter
	will be based upon the activities that you last performed on the
	SIG whose configuration file is currently active.  For instance,
	if you've just finshed using the T command to download  messages
	a R<ead>  will appear  to read	the messages  you've downloaded.
	The default "suggestion" is executed by pressing the enter key.

	During automatic operation,  any keyboard input  (except ESCape)
	is sent to CIS.  Thus, if an error  occurs, you can type  in the
	correct command or response.  Or, if you wish to stop  automatic
	processing, use the ESCape key twice to enter Terminal Mode.

	Note: The automatic  sequence can be  terminated when online  by
	hitting the ESCAPE  key twice.	Thus,  if problems develop,  you
	can gain manual control by going into Terminal Mode.

  Function Categories

	Functions  are	grouped   by  category.   The	Online	Download
	Functions (or RUN  options) are used  to access CIS  and process
	SIG messages.  The Offline Message Processing functions are used
	to  read   and	edit   messages.   Program   Control  and  Forum
	Configuration processing are the other categories.

	Here is a synopsis of the functions ATO can perform:

    o  Automatic Logon (G)

	Dials the CIS phone number, supplies your userid and password to
	gain access, instructs CIS to go to a specific page.

    o  Downloading of messages (F,Q,H,T,U,I,Y,A).

	in the SIG,  issues RM to  save waiting personal  messages, then
	issues SF;nnnn	to list  all new  message headers  with nnnn the
	number from the configure file, and goes to (M) below, OR issues
	RTN or RF;nnnn to list all new messages directly and goes to (R)
	below,	OR  issues  QS;nnnn  to  download  abbreviated	messages
	headers,  logs	 off  or   stays  connected   depending  on  the
	configuration.

    o  Offline scanning and marking of message headers (M).

     o	Downloading of selected messages (D).

	Automatic logon, issues RI or RT ONLY commands for each  message
	selected, logs off.


    o  Offline reading and replying to messages (R,V)

    o  Writing new messages to send (W)

    o  Uploading of original messages and replies (S,P)

	Automatic logon, issues RE and supplies message replies,  issues
	L and supplies new message text, logs off

    o  Special CIS message handling:
	-  ignores BEL and ;; messages,
	-  responds to (UA RE T) and "Press enter to continue:" messages,
	-  sends ^U to prevent line noise interference.
	-  sends ^Q after one minute of non-activity in case of network
	   problems
	-  processes XON and XOFF requests

  Online Download Functions


	The download functions may be one of the letters Q, F, H, or  T.
	They select the method	for downloading messages and  determines
	what other ATO functions are to be automatically performed.

	(F) downloads all messages in message number order by using  the
	    SIG software  RF command.	The messages  are read beginning
	    with  the  High  Message  Number  specified  in  the   Forum
	    configuration options.  Both the CIS and ATO HMN are updated
	    after all messages have been downloaded.

	(Q) downloads message headers using the CIS Quick Scan	command.
	    Each message header represents  one or more messages  from a
	    thread of messages.   When all of  the message headers  have
	    been  downloaded,  ATO  returns  to  the  Function Menu.  By
	    selecting the  Mark function,  you tell  ATO to  present the
	    message headers to you  for marking.  If you  are interested
	    in the message thread, mark it by responding with an M. Upon
	    returning to the Function Menu, you may select the	Download
	    function which accesses CIS and downloads the messages  that
	    you Marked.

	(H) is	similiar  to  Q,  except  that	the message headers  are
	    downloaded in message number order using the SF command, and
	    they represent only one message each.  These headers include
	    the From, To, Date, and Subj fields.

	(J) is similar to H except that headers are downloaed in  thread
	    order rather than in numerical order.

	(T) Downloads  all messages  in thread	order starting	with the
	    message number that you  supplied in the DFN  definition (or
	    New) by issuing an RTN command.  The starting message number
	    depends upon your  setting of the  HMN in the  Configuration
	    menu.   Both  the  CIS  and  ATO  HMN  are updated after all
	    messages have been downloaded.

  Online Download Functions

	(U) is	the equivalent	of "RM"  from the  Function: prompt.  It
	    will read all new messages on the SIG that are addressed  to
	    you.

	(A) Downloads all messages addressed to "All".

	(I) Downloads  messages  that  you  have  sent	by using  the RS
	    command with your ppn.

	(Y) Downloads  messages addressed  to your  ppn by  using the RS
	    command.

	These U,A,I,Y responses  are handy for	housecleaning, or for  a
	quick check to see  if a message you  left has had any	replies.
	In  general,  they  are  not  an  efficient way to use Forums or
	AUTOSIG, so they are not prompted.

	Think of: "I" = "I wrote";
		  "Y" = "You wrote";
		  "U" = "Unread" (or the end of "You wrote"),
	      and "A" = "All".

  Offline Message Processing



   D - Download messages online.

	The RI or RT commands generated by the (M)ark option are sent to
	CIS, and the text of the selected messages is saved for  viewing
	by option (R).	The message file is named "sigM.ATO".


   V - View SAVEd messages.

	A permanent message file  is available.  To place  messages into
	this file, use the <S>ave option while reading messages offline.
	You can  then display  or print  the file  by using the function
	(V).  The permanent message file is named "sigS.ATO".


   P - Preview Leave/Reply file.

	The  original  and  reply  messages  from  the sigL.ATO file are
	loaded into the message editor work areas.  ATO then invokes the
	full screen editor so that you may "Preview" the messages.   All
	editor functions are included.	Function keys to keep or discard
	the message from the sigL.ATO file are provided.


   S - Send messages online.

	Original messages that	you composed, and  any replies that  you
	made to messages while	reading offline, are sent  automatically
	to the SIG. The local file is named "sigL.ATO".


   W - Write new messages off-line

	Use the W command to  prepare messages off-line.  ATO will  send
	these messages for you when you use the Send command.

	The format and prompting is  similiar to those of the  CIS Leave
	command.  You are  first prompted for  the addressee (To:),  and
	then for the subject of the message.  At the To: prompt, you may
	enter the person's name and userid, or press Enter to invoke the
	ATOPPN Address Book processor.	The ATOPPN processor can fill in
	the person's name and userid for you.

   R - Read and reply offline.

	You can read messages by using	the R command at the Main  Menu.
	If there are  any messages stored  in the forum's  message file,
	they are displayed.

	Each  message  is  displayed  one  screen  full at a time.  If a
	message requires two screens, a "more" prompt will appear in the
	lower right hand side of the screen.  At this "More" prompt, you
	may enter any of the Read responses, or press Enter to	continue
	to the next page.

	From the  second screen  of a  multiple screen	message, you may
	redisplay the first screen by using the A (again) command.


	The  following	option	list  is  displayed  at  the end of each
	message:

  # 13895  <Enter>  Quit Bak/Top/End/Agn Loc/Nxt Mail Hdr/Pr/Sav Re/Ua/Join Del


	If you	choose to  reply, the  compose offline	(W) function  is
	invoked  and  you  are	placed	in  the  message  editor.   Upon
	completing  your  reply,  the  next  message  is presented.  ATO
	creates RE  commands followed  by your	message text  in the ATO
	leave file (xxxL.ATO).

	AUTOSIG provides  insurance if	the message  you replied  to was
	deleted before you  got back online.   As a backup,  the Fm: and
	Subj: lines  of the  original message  are stored,  and, if  CIS
	can't find the original message,  your reply will be left  as if
	you had written a new message with the same subject.

	UA> lets  you reply  to the  sender of	the original message but
	       allows you change the subject and/or section number.

	J>oin lets you reply to the receiver of the message, the reverse
	       of the UA  command.  In a  sense, it lets  you "Join" the
	       conversation,  not  by  replying,  but  by talking to the
	       person who is to  receive the current message.	When you
	       type  "J",  you'll  be  given  the choice of changing the
	       subject.

	S>ave  puts  the  current  message  in	the  "xxxS.ATO" file for
	       archiving.

	T>op returns you  to the top  of the message  file.  The message

	B>ack  displays  the  message  prior  to  the  current	message.
	       Multiple messages can be  displayed by issuing the  B>ack

	E>nd is the opposite of T>op.  It takes you to the last  message
	       in the file.

	A>gain	simply	repeats  the  same  message.  Useful only when a
	       message goes to a second screen.

	L>ocate searches for a text string in the current message  file.
	       The L>ocate function  only searches forward.   When asked
	       to  enter  the  Locate  text,  you  may	enter  up to 128
	       characters including blanks, commas, or any other special
	       characters.  The search is case sensitive.  If you supply
	       text in	upper case,  L>ocate only  stops when  the upper
	       case text if found.

	N>ext  repeats	the  L>ocate  search  until  the last message is
	       reached.

	Q>uit terminates the (R)ead function and returns you to the main
	       Function Menu.

	H>dr causes a printer formfeed and prints the current message to
	       the  printer.   This  is  handy	when  you  want a single
	       message	on  hardcopy  as  in  comparsion  to  the P>rint
	       command.

	P>rint copies the current message to the printer.  A title  line
	       is printed at  the top of  the first page.   It gives the
	       name  of  the  SIG  and	the  current time and date.  The
	       system printer, LPT1, is used.  ATO will send a form feed
	       when it thinks that a printer page is full.  You tell ATO
	       (in the	PC Options  menu) how  many lines  per page  you
	       printer can process.

	M>ail is like the R>eply command except that the reply is mailed
	       to an Easyplex user.  The  MA command is used instead  of
	       the S command.

	<enter> continues to the next message.

	the stay connect option.


   C - Change to Primary Menu

	Invokes the Primary menu so that you may change or edit  forums,
	or hosts, or  modify your AUTO	list.  If you  have selected the
	"remain connected" option  during the configuration  process you
	can use  this feature  to go  to another  SIG during the current
	call and execute an ATO function.


   1 - AUTOmatic first pass

	Invokes AUTO  to process  your AUTO  forum list  and access each
	forum for which you have supplied commands.


   2 - AUTOmatic second pass

	Invokes AUTO to process all forums in your AUTO list which  have
	a S> or D> file to be processed.  That is, replies to be sent or
	marked messages to be downloaded.


   G - Go online, terminal mode.

	Tells ATO  to go  into Terminal  Mode.	If  you are  not already
	online,  you  are  asked  "Do  you  want to auto-logon?  (y/N)".
	Answering with a Y results in ATO dialing the Host and going  to
	the selected Forum.  The next messages from ATO, "----  TERMINAL
	MODE ---" and  "Enter ctrl-D to  exit, alt-A for  keys" tell you
	that you are online and  in Terminal mode.  Operation from  this
	point is up to you.  To terminate the online mode, enter ctrl-D.
	File  transfer	and  program  function	keys  are  available  in
	terminal mode.

  CIS High Message Number


	The  CIS  high	message  number  (HMN)	is  used as the starting
	message number for many of ATO's functions.  ATO keeps a  record
	of the HMN  for each forum  in the ATO	Definition (AUTOSIG.DFN)
	file.  The HMN may be a number or the letter N. An N is used  to
	tell CIS to process new messages only.

	The CIS and ATO HMN is automatically updated with the number  of
	the last message processed during an online function.  That  is,
	the CIS and ATO high message number is set to the number of  the
	last  message  downloaded  by  the  T  (read  thread) or F (read
	forward) commands.

	The HMN is  not affected by  the commands that	download message
	headers until  you process  the headers  with the  Mark command.
	This allows  ATO to  use the  SF and  QS message header scanning
	functions regardless of the CIS HMN. The ATO HMN is not  updated
	until you have processed the message headers.

	The  HMN  is  also  used  for  numbering  Email  messages.   ATO
	automatically numbers Email messages for reference purposes  and
	for naming any binary  files that are automatically  downloaded.
	You may choose any starting number for Email messages by putting
	the desired number, or an N, in the forum options for the  Email
	entry.

  Multiple SIG Sessions


	AUTOSIG offers two ways to access several SIGs during one logon.
	To do it automatically, see the section on "AUTO".  You can also
	use the O>ptions menu to  instruct AUTOSIG to stay connected  as
	you move from SIG to SIG.

	You may "run" functions on  multiple SIG's with AUTOSIG, but  it
	requires that you set the "Stay Connected" option in the initial
	SIG configuration  to "Y(es)".   The procedure  for multiple SIG
	actions during one connect sessions are as follows:

	1) Select the first SIG you  want to visit.  Make sure that  the
	stay connected option is set to yes.

	2) Select the function menu option to perform the task you want.

	3) After the call is placed  and the RUN option is executed  you
	will be presented with the main AUTOSIG menu again.  The message
	in the upper right hand of the screen should display the message
	"PC is connected".  You are still connected.

	4)  Use  the  C  option  (Change  to  another  SIG)  to  see the
	configuration files on the disk.

	5) Select the letter for another SIG.

	6) After the new SIG is  selected enter the option for that  SIG
	(i.e.  Q,F,H,T,S, etc.).

	7) Repeat this process for as many SIG's as you want to visit.

	8) Unless the last SIG you visit has the "Stay connected" option
	set to "N(o)" in the configuration select the Z option from  the
	main  AUTOSIG  menu  to  send  CIS  a OFF command to disconnect.

  AUTO - Automatically Access Several SIGs


	AUTO is a  feature of ATO  that enables an  internally-generated
	batch file  for AUTOSIG.   Menu-driven, it  permits specifying a
	routine for ATO to follow  for online sessions.  The batch  file
	is stored in the DFN file.  Refer to Figure 6. for an example of
	the AUTO Build menu.

	There are three parts to AUTO:

	  - the AUTO list, which you create using an ATO editor
	  - the first AUTO pass, also referred to as /1 or 1 or F1;
	    in which ATO automatically access CIS to download
	    Email messages, messages headers, or message thread
	  - the second AUTO pass, also referred to as /2 or 2 or F2;
	    in which ATO processes your offline requests such as sending
	    replies or download marked messages

	If you have never defined an AUTO list, you will need to  select
	the Modify AUTO list item  from the Primary menu.  You	are then
	presented with an  AUTO list of  forums and commands.	Move the
	cursor next to a forum you wish to access automatically.   Enter
	the letters for each command  that you wish to perform,  e.g.  Q
	to download Quick Scan headers.  You may delete a forum from the
	AUTO list by  entering all blanks  after the forum  name.  Press
	the ESCape when  you are finished,  and you are  returned to the
	Primary  menu.	 Your  AUTO  list  has	now  been  stored in the
	AUTOSIG.DFN file.

	AUTO can be enabled in many ways: by using " /1" as part of your
	command to load AUTOSIG, e.g., "AUTOSIG /1".  (The space  before
	the slash  is necessary.)   Use the  " /1"  extension only  if a
	routine has already been created.  Or you can select the pass  1
	(F1) or pass 2 (F2) items from the Primary menu, or use the 1 or
	2 commands from the main Function menu.

	Any  routine  created  is  saved  and  becomes	permanent  until
	changed.  ATO can then	be run normally or  with the " /1"  or "
	/2" switches, or  from the F1  or F2 keys  at the Primary  menu.
	The /1 and /2  switches are different from  the F1 and F2  keys.
	The switches invoke AUTO immediatley.

	The F1 and F2 keys require  that you enter the time of	day when
	AUTO is  to execute.   If you  just press  the <enter> key, AUTO
	begins immediately.   Otherwise, you  may enter  the time and/or
	day when  AUTO is  to run.   The time  must be	supplied in  the
	format	"hh:mm"  where  "hh"  is  the  hour  in military/24 hour
	format, and "mm" is the minutes.  For example, if you want  AUTO
	pass 1 to begin at 4:35 pm, you would enter 16:35.

  AUTO - Automatically Access Several SIGs

	If AUTO is to  start on another day,  you supply the date  after
	the  time  in  the  format  ",mm-dd"  where the coma is required
	between the time and date, and "mm" is the current month  number
	(e.g. 9 for  September), and the  "dd is the  day of the  month.
	For example,  to start	AUTO at  4:35 pm  on September	9, enter
	"16:35,09-09" when asked "When?".

	AUTO will  S>end or  D>ownload messages  automatically as  well.
	After the  first pass  with AUTO,  the "2"  option can  be used.
	Selecting this causes  AUTO to scan  your disks to  see if there
	are messages waiting  to be sent  or downloaded.  If  there are,
	ATO will  go online  again to  perform those  functions.  If you
	have returned to DOS in the interim, the extension " /2" will do
	the same thing.

	AUTO stays  in this  mode until  you return  to DOS.  Because of
	this, you can use the Q> option  for a quick scan; use " /2"  to
	download  the  messages;  R>ead  them  offline;  compose replies
	offline; and then use " /2" again to S>end replies.

	IMPORTANT: Whenever you select AUTO, whether /1 or /2, it checks
	all forums in the AUTO list which have commands to see if  there
	are any D> or  S> files.  If a	forum has all blanks,  it is not
	accessed, whether there are D> or S> files for it or not.

	If you'd prefer to use ATO without AUTO, it can still help.  You
	can use " /2" anytime you want to go online to download messages
	you marked offline, or to send new messages.  It's a good way to
	see how quickly AUTO works,  and you won't be taken  back online
	unless you have  a live D>  or S> file.   In use, the  main menu
	item of choice offline becomes "C".

	Also, your O>ption choice of "Y" or "N" for "Stay connected y/n"
	in your AUTOSIG.DFN  file is overridden  by AUTO, so  there's no
	need to change it from what you normally use 'manually.' You can
	exit out of AUTO at any time by hitting <Esc> <Esc>.  If you  do
	it before  your modem  sends "CONNECT",  AUTO will  hang up  and
	return you to the main	menu; otherwise, from what you	normally
	use  'manually.'  You  can  exil  out  of  AUTO at any ready for
	keyboard input.

  EASYPLEX (E-Mail) Operation


	Although SIG  and Forum  messages are  one way	of communicating
	when you know that the	addressee will check the forum,  AUTOSIG
	makes  sending	messages   via	CIS's  electronic   mail  system
	("EasyPlex")  simple.   It's  a  good  idea to use EasyPlex when
	you're not sure if  the receipent is going  to be on the  SIG in
	time to pick up the message before it scrolls off.  In AUTOSIG's
	Email routine, messages are  reformatted so they can  be handled
	just like SIG messages.  You may also send EMAIL by composing  a
	reply to a forum message and then using the M or MA option.

	When you use AUTOSIG for the  first time, or if your main  drive
	disk doesn't have a .DFN file created by AUTOSIG, the menu  will
	offer at least two  selections: IBMCOM and EMAIL.   Instructions
	for  IBMCOM  are  elsewhere.   Select  the menu letter for EMAIL
	(probably 'B'), then select the Edit HOST Options item, F4.  You
	are presented with a Host Options menu for editing.  Change  the
	CIS phone number  and enter your  ID# and password.   The 'Forum
	name' must contain "MAIL", "Mail" or "mail"; the CIS page number
	must be "EASYPLEX"  or "EASY" for  this part of  AUTOSIG to work
	correctly.

	Next, go online normally and, at the "!" or "OK" prompt, type Go
	easy.  Select menu option 5 (ADDRESS book).  At the next prompt,
	select 5 again (Enter/Change your  NAME).  Type in the name  you
	want to appear	in the 'From:'  line of your  EasyPlex messages,
	and then log off following the menus.


	Having done that,  EasyPlex will appear  to be identical  to the
	SIGs, with only a couple of exceptions:


	  - The "To:" prompt will only accept a CIS ID number.  If  you
	    forget, AUTOSIG will remind you.

	  - Some  AUTOSIG  menu  options,  because of the way  EasyPlex
	    works, are not available. <Q>uick and scan and <M>ark,  for
	    example don't work with EasyPlex.

	  - Email messages are numbered by ATO beginning with number 1.
	    You may change this starting number by selecting the Edit Forum
	    Options item from the Primary menu, and changing the High Message
	    Number (HMN) for your EMAIL forum.

  EASYPLEX (E-Mail) Operation

	ATO  may  contain  a  SIG  defined  for Email, even if you never
	intend	to  use  this  feature.   The  name  of the 'SIG' can be
	changed, but it must contain "MAIL", "Mail", or "mail".

	If ATO	freezes while  using the  Email function,  it's probably
	because you haven't  entered your name  in the EasyPlex  address
	book (see  above), or  because your  parity isn't  set to  zero.
	Although the Email routine imitates  a SIG, it uses a  different
	uploading procedure  (a prompted  file transfer,  rather than  a
	line-by-line dump).


	The prompt character is not used by ATO during Email operation.

	Be careful when using the Preview command to avoid altering the
	last line of an Email  message.  The last line contains special
	information for ATO to use when sending the message.


	Binary EMAIL messages are automatically downloaded using the CIS
	B  protocol.   The  resulting  file  has  a  name  of  the  form
	"EMAILMSG.nnn" where nnn is the message number assigned by ATO.

  ATO Address Book - ATOPPN


    Overview

	ATOPPN allows you to maintain your own local address book of  up
	to 1000 user names and IDs. Using ATOPPN makes finding	people's
	names and ID numbers easy.

	ATOPPN is one of those	features that's much easier to  use than
	it is to explain, so here's a short summary of functions.  After
	getting the "flavor" of ATOPPN your best bet is to go for it.

	ATOPPN is invoked by using the alt-M command at the Main Menu at
	a R>ead prompt, or at the To: prompt when Writing messages.

	The display consists of  a command menu and  a list of user  IDs
	and names.   You may  enter a  letter to  invoke a  function, or
	press a cursor positioning key to scroll the display of user IDs
	and names.  The cursor positioning keys are:

	     HOME	- position to the first PPN entry
	     END	- position to the last PPN entry
	     down arrow - position to the next entry
	     up arrow	- position to the previous entry
	     PgUp	- move back 20 entries
	     PgDn	- move ahead 20 entries


	The "current"  entry is  shown in  two places:  on the left side
	above the  command menu,  and highighted  in the  list of  PPNs.
	This is the entry  that is the subject	of any Change or  Delete
	commands, and of the Paste command.

	You may exit the program by using the Q command to save  changes
	and quit,  or the  ESCape command  to not  save any  changes and
	abort.

	The display gives  you the name  of the PPN  file and of  a file
	which contains downloaded  CompuServe messages.  You  may change
	the PPN file name with the  B command, or the message file  name
	with the X command.

	The PPN file contains ASCII records, one for each user ID.  Each
	record ends with a carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF).  The
	user ID  begins in  column 1  and ends	in column  10.	The name
	begins in column 12 and may be up to 24 characters long.

	The ATOPPN menu appears as follows:

	obscure the sort.



    N	sort by Name

	The PPN  file is  sorted by  user name	in ascending order.  The
	sort is case insensitive.  That is, the names "bill" and  "BILL"
	are treated as the same name.


    P	Put entry to TO: field

	The user name and ID  are returned to the calling  program.  For
	AUTOSIG, this information  is copied to  the "To:" field  in the
	message editor.  Otherwise, the information is displayed on  the
	console.  For EMAIL messages, only the ID (ppn) is copied.


    R	Repeat Find to next

	Used after a successful Find command, the M command searches for
	the next occurrance of the text in the PPN file.


    S	Sort by userid/ppn

	The PPN file is sorted by user ID (PPN) in ascending order.

V. Special Processing

  ATO Address Book - ATOPPN

    U	Update file from msgs

	ATOPPN scans the CIS message file for message headers.	It  then
	extracts the user names and IDs from the "Fm:" line.  When a new
	userid is encountered, you are given the prompt:

	   Add 7xxxx,xxxx new user
	   Y>es, n>o, s>top asking, q>quit?

	Respond with a Y to add the new userid, an N to bypass , an S to
	add  the  userid  and  stop  asking  each  time  a new userid is
	encountered, or with a Q to stop processing the message file.

    Q	Quit, return to ATO

	You are returned to  ATO, and if any  changes were made the  PPN
	file is re-written.

    ESC  Abort, return to ATO without updating

	You are returned to ATO  and no updates are processed.	 The PPN
	file remains unchanged.

VI. Terminal Mode

  Introduction


	In addition to automatic access  to CompuServe, ATO can be  used
	as a simple terminal program.  This enable you to

	       - go to other CIS areas
	       - upload or download files from DL data libraries
	       - save CIS information in a disk file
	       - use split screen in a COnference

	Terminal mode in entered by selecting function option (G).   You
	are given the option to automatically logon to CIS. The  current
	configuration setting is used for dialing and page  information.
	When you enter the SIG	via the "Go on-line" function  ATO sends
	the string "OP;SED;SM N ;S" which will put you in non stop mode.
	You  may  manually  send  OP;SM  A;S  to  put you back into stop
	between message mode.

	Terminal mode is also entered  when the "ESCape" key is  entered
	twice from the keyboard while  ATO is online.  To exit	terminal
	mode, and  return to  the Function  Menu, enter  a "ctrl-D"  key
	combination.  You are asked:

		  "Have you left forum-name? (y/N)

	If you went  to another forum  while in terminal  mode, reply Y.
	Otherwise, press  enter.  If  you have	set "Stay  connected" in
	your  forum  options  to  No,  you  are  asked: "Stay connected?
	(Y/n)".  Reply Y if you  want to stay connected and  access more
	forums.  Otherwise, reply N and ATO will log you off.

	If your terminal is defined as a Vidtex terminal, ATO recognizes
	most of the special escape sequences for clearing the screen and
	positioning the cursor.

VI. Terminal Mode

  Defining Function Keys


	The  keyboard  keys  F1  through  F10  are  available as Program
	Function Keys.	 Pressing one  of these  keys "sends"  a command
	that you have assigned to the key.  Function key definitions are
	save in the DFN file for each SIG. You create (or modify)  these
	definitions by using the "alt-K" key combination.

	Alt-K results in a display of the current key definitions.  This
	is a small window in the upper right corner of the display.  Use
	the cursor positioning	keys and other	keyboard keys to  add or
	modify data.   The Enter  key moves  to the  next key definition
	line.	All  function  key  strings  are sent automatically when
	pressed; there is no way to define a function key string and not
	have it automatically followed by a carriage return.

	You do not need to be  online to define these keys.  Select  G>o
	online	for  AUTOSIG's  main  menu,  and  you'll  be prompted to
	determine if you want to go online.  Reply "N", and then hit the
	Alt-K key combination.

	Use the ESCape	key to end  the editing of  the key definitions,
	and to	return to  Terminal Mode.   The first  six characters of
	each key are displayed, as a reminder, on line 25 of the display
	whenever Terminal Mode is entered.   You may remove the line  25
	display by using the alt-C keys.

  Terminal Mode Special Keys


	While in Terminal Mode, ATO assigns special functions to these
	keys:


	  alt-A     displays a list of alt- keys that you may use

	  alt-B     toggles the sending of beeps and bells

	  alt-C     clears the screen and removes the line 25 display
		    of the F-key definitions

	  alt-D     initiate downloading, save all received data in
		    a capture file (PgDn may be substituted)

	  alt-E     invokes a DOS shell so that you may execute other
		    programs without exiting ATO



	  alt-F     displays the names of files on a selected drive

	  alt-H     send modem commands to hang up (disconnect)

	  alt-K     displays the function keys and allows you to edit
		    them

	  alt-M     invokes the ATO PPN Address Book processor

	  alt-O     copies your F- function key definition to ALL your
		    other forums

	  alt-P     toggle the system printer on or off to print received
		    data

	  alt-R     invokes the PC Options menu so that you may change
		    screen colors or other options

	  alt-S     splits the screen (for conferencing), all keyboard
		    input is taken from line 25 and is buffered until a
		    carriage return is entered. The buffer is then sent
		    to CIS.

	  alt-U     initate a file upload using the BEL (^G) prompting
		    character (PgUp may be substituted)

	  ctl-HOME  Displays function keys on line 25, like KEY ON

VI. Terminal Mode

  Protocol File Transfer


	Files from the CIS data libraries (DLs) may be "downloaded" from
	CIS to your system by using ATO in the Terminal Mode.  You  tell
	CIS to download a file by using commands such as READ, TYPE,  or
	DOW when you are given the  DL: prompt by CIS, or from	the file
	prompt given at the file level during the BRO command.

	To enter Terminal Mode, select	the (G) Go Online function  from
	the  Function  Menu,  or  press  the  ESCape  key  while  ATO is
	performing an automatic function such as T.

	ATO uses the CIS "B" protocol.  When asked by CIS for a download
	or protocol  method, select  the B  protocol.  If  you have your
	terminal defined as Vidtex CIS will assume "B" protocol and  you
	will not see the menu.



    Downloading with "B" protocol

	If you use the BRO command just  enter D at the end of the  file
	description.   When  asked  for  the protocol, select CompuServe
	"B".   You'll  get  a  message  "I  need  a  filename  for  your
	computer".   Enter  the  drive  spec  (optional, if not used the
	default drive is used)	and the name you  will call the file  on
	your disk.  After that,  the transfer is automatic.   You'll see
	received  block  #  messages, and  after the transfer you'll see
	number of  characters transferred,  elapsed time  and characters
	per second.  The  NAK  value represents the number  of times CIS
	requested that a block be retransmitted.  The  ENQ  value should
	be zero.  If not, CIS has tried to  interrupt the  file transfer
	and ATO may have trouble continuing.

	Some binary files use the extension ".BIN".  From time to  time,
	you  may  run  into  files  that  are  stored in binary but have
	different extensions, such as ".BQN".   To be certain of a  good
	transfer, carefully note the file  name and hit T instead  of D.
	You'll be returned to the top of the Data Library.  Type

	 DOW FILENAME.EXT/PROTO:B/TYPE:BIN.

	During B  protocol file  transfer, the	top line  of the display
	tells you the  name of the  file and when  the transfer started.
	If you are uploading a file, the file's size is also  displayed.
	The bottom line of the display	is a status line.  It tells  you
	the number of bytes of	"Data" that have been transferred  to or
	from a	file, the  number of  bytes "Sent"  and "Rcvd",  and the
	number of "Naks"  negative response due  to errors.  The  "Data"

	count is updated every 32  bytes for 300/1200 bps, and	every 64
	bytes for 2400 bps operation.


    Uploading with "B" protocol

	Files may also be uploaded (sent) to DL databases using the  "B"
	protocol.  Use the  UPL command and  follow the directions  from
	CIS. Please follow file name conventions.  Basic programs  saved
	as  ASCII  files  should  be  uploaded with the extension, .BAS.
	Text files may have any three-letter extension.  Please refer to
	the file  DL.HLP in  DL1 of  IBMNEW for  further information  on
	filename conventions.

VI. Terminal Mode

  File Transfer with DC2/DC4 and Prompting


    PgDn - Log to disk

	The "PgDn" key is used to start (or stop) logging to disk.   Any
	data sent by CIS - messages,  etc. - are written to a  disk file
	until the  "PgDn" key  is used  again to  stop logging.  The log
	file is also closed. after exiting Terminal Mode.  You	may also
	use the alt-D keys instead og PgDn to initiate logging.

	The letter C appears in the lower right corner of the screen  to
	remind you that file capture is in progress.

	To  "download"  text  files  or  Basic  programs  saved in ASCII
	format, while you're BROwsing  through the Data Library,  select
	"R" (without <Enter> ); hit PgDn; name the file as requested  by
	the program; and then hit  <Enter> twice.  When the download  is
	complete (CIS sends 'Key <Enter> to continue) hit PgDn again  to
	close the file on your PC, followed by <Enter>.



    PgUp - Upload from disk

	The "PgUp" key  initiates an upload  operation.  You supply  the
	name of a file to be  transferred to CIS. Records from the  file
	are transmitted  one at  a time  as the  BEL prompt character is
	received.  Thus, this is  a "prompting" protocol.  It  is useful
	for uploading messages, or files,  when the "A" protocol is  not
	appropriate.   If  you	select	the  DC2/DC4  transfer protocol,
	respond Yes to the CIS	question "Do you want to  be prompted?".
	Then enter a Ctrl-G key combination as the character you want to
	be prompted with.

	You may also use the alt-U keys to initiate an ASCII upload.  If
	you need additional information on file transfer please  consult
	the file DL.HLP in  DL1 of the IBM  New Users Forum (IBMNEW)  or
	ask one of the Sysops for assistance.

VII. Message Editor

  Description of use


	The AUTOSIG editor is a quasi-full screen editor which makes use
	of most of the special	function keys on the PC  keyboard.  It's
	not a true word  processor in that it  will not wordwrap in  the
	same fashion  as you'd  expect from  a "real"  editor, but  that
	shouldn't  deter  you.   Since  CIS  will  reformat your message
	(unless you need to use the Store Unformatted feature) it's  not
	necessary that it look	exactly "right".  Holes and  other items
	will be displayed properly by the forum software.  An honest  to
	goodness full screen editor is in the works, but Any Day Now can
	sometimes drag on, and on...

	The screen consists of 25 rows by 80 columns.  The first 23 rows
	contain  message  lines.   Row	24  contains  the  addressee and
	subject  information  for  the	Leave  or Reply message.  Row 25
	lists the function  key definitions.  If  HELP is turned  off by
	using function key 10, rows 24 and 25 are blank.

	Each message line  is numbered, from  1 to 80,	in column 78  of
	each display row.   You may position  the cursor to  any line on
	the display,  or use  the <Enter>  key to  position to	the next
	line.  Because of the way CIS may reformat your message, you can
	not  enter  a  space  in  the  first column.  To get around this
	limitation, use the  right arrow or  TAB key to  position to the
	column you want.

	The  maximum  number  of  lines  you  may enter is 80, but Forum
	messages are limited to about 2000 characters, or 25 lines.  The
	editor will warn you of this when you reach the 28th line.   You
	should end  the message,  and start  a new  one if  necessary to
	continue.   The  limit	of  80	lines  is necessary for EasyPlex
	messages which can be much larger than Forum messages.

	This editor has  a simulated wordwrap.	 It will advance  to the
	next line  at an  appropriate point,  but will	not reformat the
	message as you edit.

	The TAB key moves  the cursor to the  next TAB column.	The  TAB
	columns are 1, 9, 17, 25,  etc.  The ctrl-left key skips to  the
	previous word, the ctrl-right key skips to the next word.

	About the only thing  to keep in mind  when using the editor  is
	that  the  cursor  location  is  always considered the "current"
	line.  If you  delete a line  your deletion will  start with the
	line where the cursor  is.  For example, if  you have a 20  line
	message and the  cursor is on  line 10 and  you hit the  F6 key,
	then only line 10, the current line, is deleted.

	The INSERT function  adds a blank  line AFTER the  current line.


AUTOSIG User's Manual                                         Page 63


VII. Message Editor

  Description of use

	Lines are added to the end when ENTER is used on the last line.

	There  is  a  major  difference  between  the [Ctrl-End] and Del
	function as opposed to the  DELETE function.  A Ctrl-End or  Del
	erasure will leave a blank line which CIS will assume is the end
	of the message (unless you put a period or other characters back
	in the line).  The DELETE function truly deletes the line and it
	will not appear in the message upload file.

	When creating a message always remember that your input might be
	handled by SED (the Sig EDitor) and a blank line is considered a
	message  termination.	If  you  want  to  put a blank line in a
	message enter a  period on the	line you want  blank.  If you're
	using EDIT the periods will not  be printed so feel free to  put
	them in.

	Previous versions of ATO could only upload messages by using the
	SED Sig EDitor.  ATO can now  use either the SED or EDIT  modes.
	The EDIT message editor is more difficult for some to use  while
	online, but it is much faster for uploading messages.

  Editor Import Function


	You press F9 to tell ATO  to import a file.  This allows  you to
	read a	file into  the editor  work area.   Thus, you can insert
	data from files directly into your messages.

	When you press F9, ATO asks you to where to find the file:

	    Enter import d:\path [C:\ATO]

	You may  press enter  to use  the Forum  options drive	and path
	(e.g.  C:\ATO), or you may type in a new drive and path.

	Next,  ATO  displays  a  list  of  files in that directory.  For
	example:

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   AUTOSIG .DFN AUTOSIG .JUN ATO360  .DOC ATO	.EXE ACLS  .EXE PANELS	.2
   IBMCOMM .ATO IBMCOML .ATO IBMCOMS .ATO

    File to import:

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Enter the name of the file you wish to Import, or press Enter to
	change to another directory.  If ATO can not find the file,  you
	will receive the message:

	    filename not found.
	    Key 'X' to abort; any other key to retry.

	Press X to cancel the import request, or press Enter to re-enter
	the drive and path names.

	When  you  import  a  file  while  writing  a message, that file
	becomes  part  of  the	message  you  are  writing,  and  it  is
	displayed.  Because files with	the extension ".ATO" are  in the
	precise format of CIS messages, they cannot be imported, and  an
	error message will be displayed.

  Replying to messages


	When  you  select  F4  or  Alt-F4,  you  are  presented with the
	options:

   S>ave, P>rivate, U>nformatted, X>SPU, M>ail, D>elete original or <Enter>


   "S" will send the message and permit CIS to reformat it to the screen
       format set by anyone who reads it.

   "U"  will send the message exactly as written.  This is convenient if
	you include tables in a message.

   "P"  sends  the  message  privately  on  SIGs where  this  option  is
	enabled.  IMPORTANT: AUTOSIG does not trap errors if you attempt
	to send a (P)rivate  message on a SIG  where the Sysop does  not
	allow this type of message.  Don't use this option unless you're
	certain that it is permitted.

	At this writing,  the IBM Forums allow	private messages,
	as do most others.

   "X"  sends the message Privately, as is, and instructs CIS to not
	reformat it.

   "M"  sends the message as Easyplex (Email) by using the MA command

   "D"  deletes the original message (if addressed to you).

	Other options may be displayed	at this point, depending on  CIS
	requirements and  whether you  are using  W>rite, U>ser address,
	J>oin, or R>eply.  These include prompts for the adressee's User
	ID (PPN), and the Section number.  Simply follow the prompts  to
	finish storing the message.

VIII. Accounting Log - ACLS

  Log Files

	There  is  one	other  set  of	files  created and maintained by
	AUTOSIG.  They are the AUTOSIG.mmm  Log files.	The 'mmm' is  an
	abbreviation for  the current  month.  The  Log files  contain a
	record of your time on	Compuserve.  There is one record  in the
	file for every	access to CIS  by ATO. Each  record contains the
	following:

	   Date,Baud,Time-on,Time-off,Elapsed-time,Sig-name[flag]


	The file can be displayed  with the TYPE command, or  other text
	display programs such as LIST.

	The [flag] code indicates the condition in which you exited  the
	SIG. "+" means  that the AUTO  option was in  use; "*" indicates
	that you  selected the	"Stay Connected"  option; no  flag means
	that this was the only SIG  accessed, or that this was the  last
	in a series.  A "-" means that you uploaded a file and you  will
	receive a credit for the time used.

	If you are  using the multiple	SIG feature (the  stay connected
	option)  there	is  a  possibility  that  the  SIG name for each
	session  may  be  incorrect  depending	on  what  functions  are
	performed.  Once you take control  of the program, the log  file
	will charge all online time to the last SIG you accessed.

	If you like to keep  detailed records of SIG usage,  continue to
	keep  manual  records  even  if  you  don't use the multiple SIG
	feature.   There  will	always	be  minor  differences	in   the
	AUTOSIG.log  and  your	manual	records,  so  keep this in mind.
	Also, remember	that the  log file  keeps records  of your  time
	online to the tenth of a minute, while CIS rounds each logon  up
	to the next minute.  This  is one reason why AUTOSIG's  AUTO and
	Stay Connected options	can be much  more economical, since  the
	CIS rounding up doesn't take place until you log off.

	There is a companion program to AUTOSIG called ACLS and authored
	by Tom Neff.  You'll note a  dollar sign ($) next to "X"  on the
	main menu.  When you've finished with AUTOSIG, you can enter "$"
	instead  of  "X",  and  you  will  branch  to ACLS, which offers
	several ways of reading summaries of your connect charges.   You
	can also select this option in the middle of an AUTOSIG  session
	to  get  a  quick  accounting,	as  ACLS  provides the option of
	branching back	to AUTOSIG.  ACLS assumes that the ATO program
	file is name "ATO.EXE" and not "AUTOSIG.EXE".

	When using ACLS remember that it calculates an approximate cost
	usually on the high side.

IX. Errors and Problem Reporting

  Internal Errors


	If an error occurs during  execution, a message is displayed  on
	the top line of the display, such as ERROR 52 in LINE 1020.

	The message  contains an  error code  which is	described in the
	BASIC manual, and the line number where the problem occurred.

	If  you  can't  resolve  the  problem,  make a note of the error
	message and give the information to one of the authors.

	After the error, the  Function Menu is displayed.   Depending on
	the problem, you may decide to continue or terminate.  Any files
	created by  ATO are  left on  the current  drive.  Thus, you may
	restart processing at a later time.

	By far the most common problem is a lack of response by  AUTOSIG
	when it receives the SIG "Function" prompt.  Rather than  giving
	the command based upon your menu selection it just sits there.

	The problem is more than likely due to an inconsistency  between
	the prompt character that's been defined in the SIG OPtion  area
	and the ^G that ATO uses.

	If you are using a computer that may not be IBM compatible,  the
	screen displays may be empty.  This is due to the way ATO places
	data  directly	into  the  monitor's  display  buffer.   The  /T
	command-line parameter can be used to force ATO to write to  the
	display without using the IBM-specific display buffer addresses.
	See  page  7-8	for  further  information on this parameter, and
	others that can help resolve compatibility problems.

	Remember  that	the  default  ATO  prompt  character is a Ctrl-G
	(Bell) character.  This must be  entered in the SIG OPtion  area
	as ^G (the ^ key is the shifted 6 key).  The CIS OPtion  program
	will not accept CTRL-G as a valid prompt character.

IX. Errors and Problem Reporting

  Trouble Shooting


	AUTOSIG traps  and recovers  from all  possible errors	that the
	authors  have  identified.   There  are  only two occasions when
	you're likely to see any indication of an error.

	The  first  is	if  you  see  ASCII  243  on  your  screen  (the
	mathematical  symbol  for  "less  than  or  equal  to").    This
	indicates that ATO has trapped	an error at the modem.	 This is
	likely to happen once or twice both logging on and logging  off,
	and is not a problem.  If it happens repeatedly elsewhere, check
	your modem and the wires connecting it to the PC.

	The second  is if  you didn't  let ATO  run its  full course and
	broke out  of the  program or  turned your  computer off  before
	returning to DOS. This will  not harm your computer, but  it may
	leave some stray files behind.	No corrective action is  needed,
	except to always try to let ATO run its full course, from DOS to
	execution and back to DOS. Since ATO has so many files open it's
	a good idea to do a CHKDSK to identify any lost clusters.   This
	action will probably result in your "high message number"  being
	corrupted if you use on of the AUTOSIG functions that  maintains
	and depends on that number.

	Other than these two problems, if you see a message in the upper
	right  corner  of  your  display  indicating  "Error  nn at Line
	nnnnn",  please  leave  a  message  the IBM Communications Forum
	(IBMCOM).  One of the authors will respond.

	If you're having problems  with ATO's display, this  is probably
	caused by incompatibility between your computer and some of  the
	ATO code, which is IBM-PC specific.  Although ATO runs fine  "as
	is" on most compatibles,  there are several "switches"  that can
	get around compatibility problems.  See the section on Switches.

	There  are  other  problems  that  can	arise when CompuServe is
	acting up and sends  something ATO doesn't expect.   Again, most
	of  these  problems  are  trapped  and fixed automatically, but,
	given  the  infinite  number  of  possible  miscues that CIS can
	generate, not all can be  fixed.  Here are some of  the possible
	ones:

IX. Errors and Problem Reporting

  Trouble Shooting

    ATO FREEZES;  NO ACTION AT ALL

	Make sure  that you  have set  your SIG  prompt character at ^G,
	especially if this happens at the Function: prompt.  Otherwise:

	Wait a full minute.  The problem could be that CIS is busy.   If
	there is still no sign of activity, hit <ESCape> twice	followed
	by CTRL-C.  This should put you into direct contact with CIS  at
	a menu that gives you several options, including Logoff.  Select
	that one and try again later.

    MESSAGE SENT TO WRONG SIG

	This can happen using AUTO on a very noisy phone line.	What has
	happened is that  CIS sent a  false signal causing  ATO to think
	that it had moved on to another SIG. This error never happens on
	a good connection.  There's no way ATO can fix it.  FEEDBACK  to
	CIS might help.

    FILES BUSY (Code xxnn) ...

	This is a  CIS message that,  unfortunately, gives you	only two
	choices: wait it out or pull  the plug.  None of this is  unique
	to ATO; you'd have the  same problem if you logged  on manually.
	If you choose  to pull the  plug, hit <ESCape><ESC>,  which will
	return you  to the  ATO menu  with the	message that  the "PC is
	CONNECTED".   Hit  "Z".   This  will  send  "OFF"  to  CIS   and
	disconnect the modem.  Once CIS recognizes your action, it  will
	log you off.

   {{ Characters

	This symbol is encountered when there  is a lot of noise on  the
	line.  Your best bet is to  abort ATO as quickly as possible  if
	you see this symbol repeatedly.

    EASYPLEX problems

	You can name  the EasyPlex "SIG"  whatever you like,  as long as
	the name contains "MAIL", "Mail" or "mail".

	Although ATO makes  EasyPlex look and  act like a  SIG, when you
	leave a message, you are actually doing a file transfer,  rather
	than a line-by-line dump.  Your parity MUST be set at "zero"  or
	"none".  To fix  this, G TERMINAL  and reset parity.   CIS keeps
	different parameters for you at 300 and 1200 baud, so make  sure
	that you're online at the  same baud rate at which  you normally
	use ATO.  The other  likely EasyPlex  problem is  if you haven't
	inserted  your	name  in  the  EasyPlex address file.  Check the

    Message you sent arrives To: and From: YOU

	ATO tries in several different ways to recover from inability to
	send a reply to a message.  As a last resort, ATO will send your
	message to you.  If it looks like you're talking to yourself, it
	simply means  that ATO	and CIS  couldn't find  any other way to
	deliver the message.


  % NTWCPR - Communications Problem, PLEASE WAIT.(SFD 00166 050)
  % NTWJRP - Job Recovery in Progress. Type ^Q to continue.

	ATO  will  wait  out  most  CIS problems and resume faultlessly.
	However, there	is one	situation (a  CIS failure  followed by a
	recovery) when CIS asks  you to send a	CTRL-Q.  If you do  this
	manually at the  CIS prompt, ATO  will recover as  well.  If you
	don't, CIS will disconnect you in about two minutes and ATO will
	return to the main menu.


    ATO fails sending a P)rivate message

	Some Sysops have chosen not to permit (P)rivate messages.  Since
	ATO  cannot  possibly  keep  up  to  date  on  what  options are
	available on the  various SIGs, it's  up to you  to know whether
	you can send a private message on a given SIG. If in doubt, send
	it public (using 'S' or 'U'), check first with the Sysop, or try
	it 'manually' before trying it with ATO.


    ATO hangs up or aborts a file transfer

	File transfers can fail for any number of reasons, including  so
	much line noise that CIS simply aborts.  By watching the NAK and
	ENQ values, you  can get an  idea of how  smoothly a tranfer  is
	proceeding.  An  excessively high  NAK value  indicates that the
	line connection is poor and you should probably log off and call
	back.  It  may help  to try  another phone  number, or lower the
	baud rate.  In any event,  report your problems to FEEDBACK  and
	they may credit your account for the time lost.

	If you're asked if you want a prompt character at the start of a
	file transfer, make sure you specify ^G.

	If you're uploading  an 8-bit (.BIN)  file without the  expected
	".BIN" extension, don't  use the DL  menus.  In response  to the
	"DLn:"  prompt,  type  UPL  FILNME.EXT/PROTO:B/TYPE:BIN <enter>,

	where FILNME.EXT is the name of the file that you want to upload.
	You will  then be  prompted for  a filename  from your computer.
	Type in  the name  EXACTLY as  it appears  on your  message file
	disk.  If the file  is on a different  disk, make sure you  type
	the drive number first, e.g.,:

  YOU -->  UPL ATO.ARC/PROTO:B/TYPE:BIN
  CIS -->  Filename for your computer?
  YOU -->  C:AUTO.ARC  (the drive letter, ":", the filename on your disk)
  CIS -->  Upload in progress

	Other file transfer problems are most likely because you haven't
	set parity on CIS-9 to "Zero"  or "None".  Go there at the  same
	baud rate  at which  you want  to transfer  files and follow the
	menus.

  Appendix V - Using Virtual Disks

	The  following	code  can  be  used  as an AUTOEXEC.BAT file for
	ATO.EXE when used in  conjunction with RAMDSK or  other programs
	that use RAM and a phantom drive.  In this file, the assumptions
	are:

	   o Two floppy disk drives (A & B)
	   o AUTOSIG.EXE, AUTOSIG.DFN and AUTOSIG.MTH (.JAN, .FEB,
	     etc.) residenton drive A:
	   o RAMDSK is part of the CONFIG.SYS file and configured as
	     drive C:
	   o A resident clock.	If not, replace the REM at line 3 with
	     'Date'and insert a new line below it:  'Time'
	   o AUTOSIG.EXE has been renamed ATO.EXE

	In the unlikely event of  a crash, your .DFN file  is preserved.
	Go to drive  A: and COPY  DFN.BKP AUTOSIG.DFN.	Otherwise,  this
	file puts all files into RAMDSK and eliminates any disk-spinning
	from log on to log off.
