Introduction.
=============

     AUTOSIG is a program written specifically for CompuServe SIG use.
     It provides an automatic way of processing SIG messages which is
     quick and economic.

     AUTOSIG is a special communications program written in BASIC for
     the IBM PC. Although its main purpose is to offload messages, it
     can be used as a simple terminal program.

     AUTOSIG was derived from a program called SUPER.SIG in XA2 on the
     TRS100 SIG which was written by Howard Benner[70235,1337]. This
     version was slopped together by Vernon Buerg[74375,500] because
     my CIS bill is ridiculous.

Installation.
=============

     Before running AUTOSIG, certain SIG options must be in effect. The
     program depends upon certain sequences of events and control char-
     acters. Specifically, the prompt character (PC) must be set to ^G.
     Additionally, enter OP at the Function: prompt and set these options:

        BR    - Brief mode
        NS    - no stopping between messages
        PC ^G - set prompt  to G^
        TWM   - type waiting messages
        MWM   - mark waiting messages
        RNT   - RN command types all messages
        P     - make options permanent

     The prompt character is ^G, the bell. You will not hear the bell while
     AUTOSIG is running, but will during other sessions. You may change PC
     during non-AUTOSIG sessions, or you may change AUTOSIG to look for a
     different prompting character by changing the assignment of BEL at
     line 240. Be careful in your choice.










Operation.
==========

    Invoke AUTOSIG through BASICA with the following command:

        BASICA /F:4/C:4096

    For 1200 baud it is recommended that you compile the program with
    the following commands:

        BASCOM AUTOSIG/E/X/C:4096;
        LINK AUTOSIG;
        AUTOSIG

    Upon program start-up, a menu is presented. For the first use,
    select option (7) to reconfigure the program for your use.

        (0) - RUN
        (1) - Compose offline
        (2) - Scan and mark offline
        (3) - Read messages online
        (4) - Read and reply offline
        (5) - Send replies online
        (6) - Send originals online
        (7) - Re-configure
        (8) - Go online
        (9) - Return to BASIC























Configuration.
==============

     The file AUTOSIG.CFG is created during the first run, or is
     updated by later runs. Answer each question appropriately.
     If no change is required, press ENTER. If no more questions
     are to be answered, press ESCAPE. The information is required
     for performing dialing and logging on.

     "GO to page (PCS131)"
       - enter the CIS page number to go to
         after an automatic logon
     "CIS phone # (555-1212)"
       - enter your local CIS or net telephone number.
     "What baud rate (300)"
       - enter 300 or 1200, the comm parameters are set to
         COM1:baud,7,E,1,DS
     "Your userid (70000,000)
       - enter your CIS numbers separated by a comma
     "Your password (suppressed)"
       - enter your CIS password, it is never displayed.
     "Default disk (B)"
       - select an appropriate drive letter, three files are created,
         AUTOSIGA.TMP, AUTOSIGB.TMP, and AUTOSIGC. They are not deleted,
         so that they may be reused at any time.
     "Starting msg # or N (N)"
       - normally N is used so that all new messages are processed, but
         a message number can be substituted.
     "Modem dial commands (AT DT,)"
       - enter an appropriate command sequence for your modem.


    Defaults, or previous settings, are shown within parenthesis. The
    configuration process can be terminated by using the ESCAPE key.
















(0) RUN.
========

    This is the main function of AUTOSIG. This option performs these steps:

    Automatic Logon (8)
      - dials the CIS phone numbe,
      - supplies your userid and password to gain access,
      - instructs CIS to go to a specific page

    Downloading of message headers and marked messages
      - in the SIG, issues RM to save waiting messages, messages
      - issues SF;N to list all new message headers,
      - logs off

    Offline scanning and marking of message headers (2)

    Downloading of selected messages (3)
      - automatic logon,
      - issues RI for each message selected,
      - logs off

    Offline reading and replying to messages (4)

    Uploading of original messages and replies (5)(6)
      - automatic logon,
      - issues RE and supplies message replies,
      - issue L and supplies new message text,
      - logs off

    Note. The automatic sequence can be terminated when online
    by using the ENTER key. Thus, if problems develope, you can
    gain manual control.

















(1) Compose Offline.
====================

    Messages can be prepared offline. The format and prompting is similiar
    to those of the Leave command. Once composed, the messages can be sent
    automatically by selecting option (6).

(2) Scan and mark offline.
==========================

    The CIS message headers are listed one by one. You may Mark any that
    you wish to read later. For each message that is marked, an RI command
    is generated.

(3) Read messages online.
=========================

    The RI commands generated by option (2) are passed to CIS, and the text
    of the selected messages is saved for viewing in option (4).

(4) Read and reply offline.
===========================

    The selected messages, from (3), are displayed or printed. You are
    asked to Continue, Reply, or Delete after each one. If you choose
    to reply, option (1) - compose offline - is invoked. Upon completing
    your reply, the next message is presented. The program generates
    RE commands followed by your text.

(5) Send replies to messages.
=============================

    The replies prepared above are sent automatically to CIS using the.
    REply command.

(6) Send originals online.
==========================

    Original messages that you composed are sent automatically to CIS
    using the Leave command.

(7) Re-configure.
=================

    Invokes the configuration routine so that you may change the CIS page,
    telephone, etc.

(8) Go online.
==============

    This option operates as a simple terminal program. You may choose
    to automatically dial and logon, but then the reset is up to you.
    To terminate the online mode, enter ctrl-D.

(9) Return to BASICA.
=====================

    Terminates AUTOSIG and returns to BASICA, or DOS if the compiled
    version is used.

END.
