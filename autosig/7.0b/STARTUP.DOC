Please read this document through entirely before starting the
procedure.  That way there will be fewer surprises along the way.

This startup document is for those who desire to get started using AUTOSIG
as rapidly as possible.  It will lead you through making your initial
settings, making your CompuServe settings work with AUTOSIG, setting up a
forum, doing what is required for automatic retrieval of message headers
and messages.

After using this guide, you still need to read the manual for the details
and for some of the options (PC Options for instance) which make this
package more usable to you.  There are many refinements which are not in
this guide so you need to study the manual to get the most out of this
software.  You will also need to read it to understand the terminology.

For this setup to work correctly you must have in your current directory
the following three files:

       AUTOSIG.EXE  The AUTO program
       AUTOSIG.HLP  The help file
       CSETUP.SCR   This will automate a number of details of the
                    initial setup of CIS to work with AUTO

The following steps should be taken in order.  It shouldn't hurt to go
through them several times if something goes wrong.  Help is generally
available by pressing F1.  If these instructions don't work, please post
questions in PCCOM sect. 1 (AUTOSIG).  Comments and suggestions for
improvement will be appreciated.  Post them to Sysop in PCCOM section
1 (AUTOSIG).

--Start the program by typing AUTOSIG.
***********************************************************************
*         Enter name on initial execution                             *
***********************************************************************

--On the first execution only you will be asked for the name
which you wish to use joining forums.  Type in the name you will
be using in the forums.

--The main menu screen will appear.
***********************************************************************
*     Select the host for your modem speed and set the phone, password*
*     and other information for use with that setting                 *
*     Be sure to check which Host you are using when you go online    *
*     If you press the Up/Down arrows, you will change hosts.  If you *
*     can't log in, this is one of the first things to check          *
***********************************************************************
--The Host Selection on the left depends on the speed of your
     modem.  Select the correct one (for instance, CIS2400) using the
     up/down arrows on your keyboard.
     Press F4--Edit Host Options

     Change the Com port if you are not using COM1.  If you have odd COM
     ports, check the ATO manual for settings
     Enter a bulletin file name--like AUTOSIG.BUL (In your ATO directory)
     Enter a path to a subdirectory where you wish downloaded
     files to be placed(C:\DOWNLOAD\ for instance. Note second \).
     If you know that your modem needs certain commands, enter
     them under Modem dial commands
     PRESS F10 when finished.

************************************************************************
*   Use the following procedure to add forums where you are already a  *
*   member or which you know you will want to use.                     *
*   Repeat for each forum being added.                                 *
*                                                                      *
*   This has already been done for the forums which are on your initial*
*   menu.                                                              *
************************************************************************

--Press F5 to add a forum.
     The AUTO forum name should be a seven letter name for the forum,
            Geneol for instance
     The GO word/page is the CIS go word
            For the Geneology Forum for instance, it is Roots
     F10 to exit
************************************************************************
*   Make adjustments to CIS and mail so that AUTO will work in the best*
*   manner.                                                            *
*   Be sure you have CSETUP.SCR in your directory .                    *
*   In this and all other online procedures, if the instructions call  *
*   for "Ctrl-D to Exit, Alt-A for Help" and it is not the display     *
*   when AUTO pauses, press ESC twice to get the correct display       *
************************************************************************

--Select the Practice forum by pressing the letter beside "Practice"
     From the Practice Message Processing Menu type "G".
     You will be prompted "Do you want to auto-logon? Y/N"
     Type "Y".

     AUTO will start the automatic login, call CIS and go to the Practice
     Forum.  If you fail to log on to CIS check your Host settings, speed,
     com port, phone number, Userid and Password to be sure that they are
     correct.  When you get to the Practice forum, one of three things
     should happen--You should have:

 1.  "Ctrl-D to Exit, Alt-A for Help" after joining the forum if you were
     never a member.  ("Joining the forum" will be a series of scrolling
     screens, so wait until they stop)
 2.  "Forum !" after joining the forum if you are a member but in Menu mode
 3.  "Ctrl-D to Exit, Alt-A for Help" without joining the forum if you are
     a member.

    ** If it stops without a prompt, press ESC twice. **
     Type Alt-T(the alt key and the letter T) at either prompt
     You will see "Enter script file name [.SCR] "
     Enter CSETUP --- This should take less than three minutes

Page 3

     After some scrolling, you will be asked for your name.  Enter your
     name then press enter.  This name  will be in your Mail address
     book.
     **Even if the script looks like it is stopped or
     in a loop** wait for a minute or two (by the clock)
     before pressing ESC to abort.
     The script will adjust some settings for you.
     You will exit the program and stop at a prompt "Press Enter to
     Continue"
     Press enter and you return to the Message Processing Menu and
     are disconnected from CIS.
     Press "C" to return to the forum/host menu.

************************************************************************
*  These next steps join the actual forums which are set up in the     *
*  forum list, make some adjustments in the forum and collect message  *
*  sections and libraries.                                             *
*                                                                      *

*                                                                      *
*          1.  Always let AUTO return you to the AUTO Message          *
*              Processing Menu at the end of each "Join".  Do not      *
*              use a "GO" command in CIS to go to the next forum.  AUTO*
*              will get confused.                                      *
*                                                                      *
*          2.  ****  Do this even for forums where you are already a   *
*                    member.  If you don't do this. AUTO will not work *
*                    correctly.  ****                                  *
*                                                                      *
*          3.  Skip the "Mail" forum.  It is not really a forum        *
************************************************************************

--Select the first forum on your list.
     Again type "G" in the forum Message Processing Menu
     At the prompt "Do you want to auto-logon? Y/N" answer "Y"
     The program will log you on and enter the forum which you have
     selected.
     If you are not a member of the forum or if the options are
     set to "Menu" mode, AUTO will automatically join and go to
     the prompt at the end of the procedure, that is -- "Ctrl-D" or "Forum !"
     The next instructions are for forums which you have joined and
     are set for "Command" mode.  Otherwise go to the NEXT in the margin

     First you see "Enter Ctrl-D to exit, Alt-A for Help"
     If the program stops processing without this appearing, then
     *** press ESC twice *** then "Enter Ctrl-D" should appear
     Press Alt-J --This will join the forum (even if you are a member),
     make adjustments to the forum options and gather message sections
     and library names.
     At this point the forum prompt "Forum !" appears
NEXT
     Press Ctrl-D
     Enter "Y" to the question "Stay connected? (Y/n)"
     The prompt is "Have you left the **** forum" -- answer "N"
     *****Remember that you are still online and in the forum which you just
          left--If this is a pay forum, it is costing you to stay on line --
