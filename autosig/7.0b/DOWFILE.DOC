                   DOWFILE.BAT

Dowfile.bat is a simple batch file that use command line parameters to 
create an Autosig script file for downloading files from CIS/ZNT forum
libraries.  The resulting script file (DOWFILE.SCR) can be used with
AUTOSIG via the/X command line parameter, or with the Alt-T command 
when AUTOSIG is in the Terminal mode.

The simplest syntax of DOWFILE.BAT is: 
 DOWFILE [/A] forum lib# filename [2nd-lib# 2nd-filename etc.] [/AP{1,2}]

For example:
  DOWFILE IBMCOM 3 COMM3.ARC 1 ACLS.ARC 1 ATODV.ARC 1 SETUP.ARC /AP1
will log on to the IBMCOM forum, go to Data Library 3, download 
"comm3.arc" (using the Compuserve Quick B protocol), switch to Library 1,
download "acls.arc," etc., and then initiate Autopass 1.  Without the
optional /AP{1,2} switch, Autosig will log you off after the last DL.

Entering only "dowfile" or entering "dowfile ?" will show a help screen 
reminder of the required syntax.

The more complex syntax uses an F or G to signal that you wish to go to
a new forum and download one or more files there.  This syntax is:
 DOWFILE forum 1st-lib# 1st-filename [second-lib# second-filename] 
 F forum2 nth-lib# nth-filename G forum3 n+1th-lib# n+1th-filename etc.
 Thus  DOWFILE IBMCOM 3 COMM3.ARC F PCVENA 8 MX602P.EXE 8 MX602A.EXE
 G ZNT:FREEUTIL 1 Vulcan.doc
 will log on to the IBMCOM forum, go to Data Library 3, download
 "comm3.arc," go to Lib 8 of PCVENA and download the files MX602P.EXE and
 MX602A.EXE, go to the ZNT:FREEUTIL area and DL Vulcan.doc from Lib 1,
 then log off.  All Dowfile DLs use the CIS Quick B protocol.

The simple and complex syntaxes can be combined in any order, so long as the
total number of characters in the command does not exceed 127. (DOS limit)
To circumvent this limit and allow even more complex download lists, using
the optional /A switch immediately after "dowfile" tells the dowfile.bat
program that the download (and optional autopass) parameters that follow
should be _appended_ to the existing dowfile.scr, rather than overwriting
it.  If an appending dowfile command is to DL from the _same_ forum in
which the previous dowfile command suspended operations, use the switch
"/AS" rather than "/A."  

NOTE 1: Only the _last_ dowfile command in a scripting series may end with
 the /AP{1,2} switch, and each dowfile command _must_ begin with a forum
 name unless the /AS switch is used.

NOTE 2: The initial forum and those following an F switch must be specified
 by the appropriate Autosig forum names (as shown on the top line of the
 Forum Configuration Screen), while those following a G switch must be 
 specified by the correct CIS/ZNT Goword. The purpose of the G switch is
 to allow downloading from a forum not currently included in your active
 definition file, but you must have already joined the forum, and your
 forum options must be ATO-compatible; to use DOWFILE at all you also must
  have chosen CIS B as your standard DL protocol.

This batch file was uploaded 2/94 to fix a problem in getting more than one
file at a time, and to allow downloads from more than one forum in a pass.
  Thanks to Jim McKeown for help and suggestions.

This has been a time-saver to me, and may be more convenient than 
the BRO facility for quick downloads of known files.  I hope it's 
useful to you.
