  ------------					       March 17, 1989

  Purpose:

	To create the smallest possible archive files.

  Usage:
	LARC d:[\inpath\]filespec  [d:\outpath]
|				   [/A] [/C] [/G] [/K] [/P] [/Z] [/H]
				   [/L] [/R]

	The input drive and/or path is required and specifies the
	location of file(s) to be processed.  The inpath name is
	optional.  You may include wildcards.  The extension defaults
	to ARC.

	The output drive and path are optional. If omitted, the
	original ARC files are replaced with any smaller versions
	created by the LARC process. If supplied, all archive files
	are newly created in the output directory. This is handy
	for insuring that you get the archive file in the format
	that you want, e.g. in SEA ARC format only.

	At least two disk directories are required.  The first (from
	d:\inpath) contains the original files.  The second (the
	current drive and path) is used for temporary storage where
	all  files are extracted and re-created.  A large RAM disk
	is recommended.  Optionally, a third directory (from
	d:\outpath) is used as the destination for all new files.

	You MUST not have the d:\inpath the same as the current drive
	and path.  The current drive (and directory) is used for
	temporary work space. You can have the inpath and outpath the
	same to force replacement of all existing ARC files. The smallest
	files - in terms of bytes,  not clusters - is used.

	Use one or more of the option switches to specify the program(s)
	to be used for creating archive files:

	  /A for ARCA		  /K for PKARC	    /H for LHARC
	  /C for SEA's ARC        /P for PKPAK
	  /G for GSARC or PAK	  /Z for PKZIP

	If none is supplied, the default is to use ARCA only.

  ------------					       March 17, 1989

	If an LBR library file is encountered, it is converted to
	an ARC file. You must have LUE.COM available in the DOS path.
	If you plan to just convert LBR files, use an input file
	specification of "*.LBR" to avoid unnecessary processing.
	The LBR file is not deleted unless the /L option is supplied.
	This gives you complete control of the process.

	A summary report is produced at the end of the program. It
	is normally displayed on the screen, but you can have a
	duplicate written to the file LARC.RPT by supplying the /R
	option on the command line.

	You should have ARCA, PKXARC, PKARC, PKPAK, PKZIP, PAK, LUE
	and ARC.EXE accessible from the DOS path, preferably in a RAM
	disk, depending on the options supplied pn the command line. Of
	course, you may substitute BAT files for any of those programs.


	Each ARC file is individually unpacked by PKXARC (so that
	squashed files can be processed), and then ARCed using ARC,
	PKARC, PKPAK and/or ARCA. If any of the resulting ARC files is
	smaller than the original, the original is immediately
	replaced. The original ARC file's date and time are preserved.

	Each PAK file is unpacked by the GSARC/PAK program. If /G is
	specified, a PAK file is created in place of the original
	ARC file.

	Each ZIP file is unpacked with PKUNZIP. If /Z is specified,
	a new ZIP file is created in place of the original ARC, LBR,
	or PAK file if the ZIP file is smaller.

	It takes a long time to process several archive files. Figure
	an hour for 10 megs of files on an AT.	LARC beeps when
	it is finished, and displays a summary of the files processed.

	You can eliminate squashed files by using an early version
	of PKARC, or by patching PKARC to disable squashing.

	I use LARC to process newly uploaded files. It is a brute
	force method of testing the integrity of the files, and
	results in saving disk space.

     o	There are several ARC files in the directory C:\TEST; drive
	D: is an 800K RAM disk. Any smaller ARC files replace the
	existing files. Only ARC is used.

	     d:|cd \
	     larc c:\test\*

     o	All ARC files in the directory C:\UPLOADS are copied to a
	new directory, C:\TEST, in their smallest versions. The disk
	directory C:\WORK is the current directory and is used for
	temporarily extracting ARC files. All files in C:\WORK are
	deleted. Both ARCA and PKARC are used.

	     c:|cd \work
	     larc c:\uploads\* c:\test /A/P

     o	Convert all library LBR files on C:\TEST to ARC files, and
	delete the original library files. Drive d: is used for
	temporary storage.

	     d:
	     larc c:\test\*.lbr /l

     o	Replace existing ARC file on B:\ with the smallest ARC
	files. Drive C: is used for temporary storage.

	     c:
	     larc b:\* b:\ /a/p/c

   1.5, 3/15/87
	Ccorrects an overflow (error 6) problem, and adds another check to
	be sure that the temporary directory is different from the input and
	output directories. Remember, all files in the temporary directory
	are deleted.

	Also, DOS 3.1 or later is required for proper operation.
	There's no guarentee of anything, anyway.


   1.6, 4/15/87
	Adds more checks to insure that the temporary directory is empty.
	Also, you may now press ESCape while LARC is running to cancel it.
	A check was added to stop processing if an error occurred creating
	a new ARC file

   2.1, 2/24/89
	Adds internal tables for specifying the various programs to be used.
	The defaults include ARCA, ARC, PAK, PKARC, PKPAK, and PKZIP.

   2.2, 3/08/89
	Correct a problem deleting original ARC files

|  2.3, 9/05/89
|	Changes to info screen.
|  2.4, 3/17/90
|	Add /H option to process LHARC (.LZH) files
|	Approximately 256k of memory is required.

	Use LARC at your own risk. There is no warranty or guarentee
	that the program will work as expected.
