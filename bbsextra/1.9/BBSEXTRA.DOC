----------------                                                   Sep  2, 1991

Purpose:        BBSEXTRA compares the files listed in your PCBoard
                directory listings (DIRnn files) to the files that
                actually exist in your download paths.

                BBSEXTRA produces reports of files that are missing,
                extra, or duplicated.

Syntax:         BBSEXTRA  [d:\path]  [/T]


                where d:\path specifies the drive and path to be used
                for temporary work files. The default is to place the
                work files in the current directory. About 100 bytes
                per file and DIR file entry is required; usually
                several hundred K-bytes.

                Specify /T to display the names of files in the DIRnn
                listings and in disk subdirectories.

Input:          Two control files are required:

                1)  DRVDIRS

                   This file contains a list of download paths. Be
                   sure to include all of your upload directories
                   and conference directories. For example:

                        W:\UPLOADS\
                        V:\ME\
                        V:\M1\
                        J:\L22\

                2)  FILEDIRS

                   This file contains a list of directory listing
                   files. For example:

                        c:\dir\dir29
                        v:\pcb\main\dir30

|                  Each entry in the directory listing file must contain
|                  a valid file name starting in column 1. The file name
|                  may be in the form 'ffffffff.ext' or 'ffffffff ext'.
|                  The file name should be followed by a file size. The
|                  output of the DOS DIR command is an acceptable format.

Output:         These files are created:

                MISSING         - a list of missing files; those
                                  listed in DIRnn files, but not
                                  found in any download path

                EXTRA           - a list of files found in a download
                                  path, but not listed in a DIRnn file.

                DUPES           - a list of files of the same name
                                  found in more than one download path

                Four large temporary files (30-40 bytes per file entry)
                are created.  Use a RAM disk if you can.

Operation:      BBSEXTRA builds a list of all files contained in the
                download paths and writes the list to a temporary
                file called BBSEXTT1.}}}.  Then, all file names listed
                in the DIRnn files are written to the temporary file
                called BBSEXTT2.}}}.  The two temporary files are
                sorted, and then compared for missing, extra, and
                extra files.

                The EXTRA files may be removed by passing the file to
                a utility like PCOPY or PMOVE. For example:

                        PCOPY @EXTRA C:\DELETED /X

                to move all unlisted files to the C:\DELETED directory.
                It's best to save any extra files, rather than simply
                deleting them.

Requirements:   BBSEXTRA needs the SORTF utility sort program.

Notes:          Written using the MS BASIC Compiler PDS Version 7.1 and
                one assembler subroutine.
                For personal use only. May not be sold.
