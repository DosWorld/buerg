ARCE Command
------------

Purpose:  To extract files from an ARC archive file.

Format:   ARCE	[d:][path]filename.ext	[filespecs...] [d:outpath] [/R]

Remarks:  The drive and path names are optional. If omitted, the
	current drive and path name is used.

	The filename must be supplied. The extension defaults
	to ARC. All files matching the supplied filename are
	processed. The ARC filename may contain the * and ?
	wildcard characters.

	If no filespecs are supplied, all files are extracted.
	Otherwise, only those ARC members which match one of the
	up to 16 filespecs are extracted.

	The extracted files may be placed on another drive, and/or
	in another subdirectory by following the optional filespecs
	with a drive designator and/or path name.

	If the file being extracted already exists, you are asked
	whether or not you want to over-write it. You may use the
	/R option to bypass this prompt.


 Examples:
 --------

	o  Extract all file from TEST.ARC onto the current drive:

	      ARCE TEST

	o  Extract only file with an extension of .ASM from the
	   archive SOURCE.ARC on drive B and in subdirectory SAVE:

	      ARCE B:\SAVE\SOURCE *.ASM

	o  Extract all files from all ARC files in the subdirectory
	   called TEST on drive C:

	      ARCE C:\TEST\*

	o  Extract all files from PROGA.ARC and place the files in
	   subdirectory OLD on drive B:

	      ARCE PROGA.ARC B:\OLD

	o  Extract all files with an extension of .COM and .EXE from
	   the archive PROGS.ARC in directory NEW\WORK on drive B,
	   and place the them in subdirectory SAVE\TEST on drive A;
	   replace existing file:

	      ARCE B:\NEW\WORK\PROGS *.COM *.EXE A:\SAVE\TEST /R


 Error Messages:
 --------------

	'filename - premature EOF reading '
	 Data is missing from the archive file.
	 The program is terminated.


	'filename - unable to set file datestamp'
	 The file datestamp is set to the current date and time,
	 and the next archive member is processed.


	'filename - WARNING: file CRC does not match!'
	 The extracted member is left on the output disk,
	 and the next archive member is processed. The file
	 is probably invalid but is left on the disk for
	 your examination.


	'Invalid filespec(s)'
	 The filespec syntax is incorrect. The filename part may
	 be from 1 to eight characters, and may include the ? or *
	 wildcard characters. The extension may be none to three
	 characters, and may include wildcards.
	 There is a maximum of 16 filespecs allowed.
	 The program terminates.


	'filename - file already exists. Overwrite it? (y/N) '
	 The member being extracted already exists. If you are
	 using a data path utility, the file may not actually be
	 in the subdirectory be used for output. Respond with the
	 letter Y to over-write the existing file, or respond with
	 the letter N to skip this member and continue to the next.


	'Abort: Stack overflow'
	 The member being extracted has invalid data. The program
	 is terminated.


	'filename - invalid decode tree count'
	 The member being extracted has invalid data. The program
	 is terminated.


	'filename - new archive format 7 not yet supported'
	 Format 7 is a special file compression method used
	 internally by SEA, the authors of ARC. Processing
	 continues with the next archive member.


	'Unable to open archive > arcname'
	 The specified ARC archive file was not found, or was
	 inaccesible. The program terminates.


	'CREATE failed > filename'
	 There was insufficient directory space, or a failure
	 accessing the output disk. The program terminates.


	'Invalid archive format!'
	 The archive file data is invalid. The program terminates.


	'Incorrect DOS version'
	 Version 2.0 or later of PC DOS must be used. The program
	 terminates


	'Not enough memory.'
	 A minimum of 112k bytes of memory is required. The program
	 terminates.


	'I/O error reading from arcname'
	 An incorrectable error occurred attempting to read data
	 from the archive file. The program terminates.


	'I/O error writing or disk full > filename'
	 There was not enough disk space to write the complete
	 archive member. The partially extracted file is scratched
	 and the program terminates.


	'No matching file(s) found'
	 No archive files were found that matched the supplied
	 filename specifications. The program terminates.
