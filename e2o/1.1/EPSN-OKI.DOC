Remarks:   The first filename specifies the "print" file to be
	   converted. The second defines the new file. If either
	   filename is omitted, you will be prompted for it.

	   Control characters encountered in the input "print" file
	   are converted from IBM-Matrix-Printer codes to OkiData codes.

	   The ESC-8, ESC-9, DC1, and DC3 control codes are ignored.
