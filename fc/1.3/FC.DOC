FC Command                                              Version 1.3
----------                                              Aug 17, 1985

Purpose:  FC compares two versions of an interpreted BASIC program
          to produce a MRG (merge) file. The MRG file can then be
          merged into the original BASIC program to yield the new
          version of the program.

Syntax:   FC

Remarks:  The BASIC programs must first be saved with the ,A (ASCII)
          option. You are prompted to enter the "original" file name,
          the "modified" file name, and the name of the file to
          contain the changes.  For example,

          FC
          Enter original file name-myprog1.bas
          Enter modified file name-myprog2.bas
          Enter   change file name-myprog1.mrg

          The file 'myprog1.mrg' will contain the statements that
          are different. You can then re-create 'myprog2.bas' by
          applying the changes to 'myprog1.bas'. For example,

          BASICA
          load"myprog1
          merge"myprog1.mrg
          save"myprog2
          system

Note:     Each file must contain an end-of-file character. If not,
          an Error 62 message will be issued.

          FC was written in assembler for speed and small size. It
          is based on the public domain FC.BAS program which is used
          as an aid to maintaining version levels.
