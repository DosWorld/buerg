LUD Command
-----------

Purpose:   To delete one or more files from a library (LBR file). 
           Optionally,  the library may be reorganized to recover 
           the space lost due to deleting members.

Format:    LUD  [d:][path]filename[.LBR] filename ... [/R]

Remarks:   The  library name must be supplied.  If a member  file 
           name is supplied, it is deleted from the library.

           To reorganize the library, supply the /R operand.

           The library filename may contain a drive,  path names, 
           and  wildcard characters.  The first file matching the 
           library filename is processed.

           Each member filename may contain wildcard characters.

           For LU86 format libraries the date/time stamps are not 
           changed, but the directory CRC is updated.

Examples:
        o  Delete member file 'TEST.DTA' from library 'STUFF.LBR'

                LUD STUFF TEST.DTA

        o  Delete all member files with and extension of 'ASM'

                LUD A:\SAVE.DIR\STUFF *.ASM

        o  Recover lost space in library 'ARLO.LBR'

                LUD ARLO /R

        o  Delete several members and reorganize library 'MONDO.LBR'

                LUD MONDO FOO.TXT *.DOC /R
