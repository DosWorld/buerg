LUT Command
-----------

Purpose:   Displays the directory of one or more library (LBR) files
           which were created by the LU or LAR utility.

Format:    LUT  [d:][path]filename[.ext]

Remarks:   The single operand names a library file. Global filename
           characters * and ? are  allowed in  the filename and  the
           extension. If the extension is omitted, LBR is assumed.

           If the filename is omitted, all LBR files on the current
           drive and in the current directory are listed.

Examples:
        1) List directories of all LBR files on current drive
                LUT

        2) List directory of all LBR files on drive B
                LUT B:

        3) List all LBR directories of filenames beginning with XYZ
                LUT XYZ*

        4) List all LBR directories for files in the path \TEST
                LUT \TEST

        5) List all LBR directories in path \TEST beginning with XYZ
                LUT \TEST\XYZ*
