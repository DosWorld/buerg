 XONE Command                                           Version 2.3
 ------------                                           Oct 12,1987

 Function
 --------
        To create an ARC file from one or more files that are
        contained within an ARC file.

 Syntax
 ------
            XONE  inputname[.ARC]  [filename]  [outputname]  [/R]

 Remarks
 -------
        The 'inputname' is required. It defines the ARC archive file
        which contains the member files that you want to extract. The
        extension defaults to .ARC.

        The 'filename' is optional. If omitted, all files in the
        archive are extracted. If supplied, only that file in the
        archive that matches the 'filename' is extracted.  Each
        extracted file is created in the ARC format using the the
        original file name.

        The 'outputname' is optional. If supplied, it defines the name
        to be used for the extracted file. To use this operand, you must
        also supply the 'filename' operand to extract a single file.

 Example:
 -------
        Extract the file TEST.DAT from the archive called DATA.ARC
        and name it TEST.ARC:

                XONE DATA TEST.DAT TEST.ARC

        The file TEST.ARC is created as a valid archive file, and it
        contains the same data as the original member file TEST.DAT.

 ------------
