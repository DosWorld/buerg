                     FV - Verbose Archive Directory Lister
                         Version 1.16 - August 1, 1989



Purpose:  To display the names and attributes of files contained
          within archive files with extensions of ARC, ZIP, PAK,
          DWC, LZH, ZOO,  and most self-extracting .COM and .EXE
          files created by ARC, ZIP, PAK and LZH.


Format:   FV  [d:][path]filespec[.ext]  [/p] [/b] [[/w] >outfile]


Notes:    If no operands are entered, a display of the program's
          command format is displayed.

          The drive and path are optional. The filespec may contain
          the wildcard characters * and ?.  All files matching the
          file specification are processed.

          If the filespec extension is omitted, all known archive
          extensions are checked.

          Use the /p parameter to pause the display when the screen
          fills.

          Use the /b parameter to suppress the d:\path information
          in the display.

          Use the /w parameter to display member names only in a 5-up
          display.

Examples:

        o  Display the directory of the TEST.ARC file, in the current
           directory:

                FV TEST

        o  Display the directories of all archive files, but redirect
           the information to the file FV.DIR:

                FV * >FV.DIR

        o  Print the directory of the file NUBIES.LZH in directory RTEST
           on drive A:

                FV A:\RTEST\NUBIESLZH >LPT1:
