SWAPNAME Command
----------------

Purpose:  To change the names of two disk files to that
          of the other file.

Format:   SWAPNAME  [d:][path]filename.ext  [d:][path][filename.ext

Remarks:  The drive and path names are optional. If omitted, the
          current drive and path name is used.

          File names must be supplied for both files. The files
          may be on different drives and/or in different paths.

          If any errors are encountered, such as invalid file names,
          both files are restored to their original names, and an
          error message is issued. The message contains a return
          code from the RENAME function. Refer to the DOS manual
          for its meaning.

             drive B:

                SWAPNAME A:\SAVE\OLD.DAT  B:\WORK\NEW.DAT
