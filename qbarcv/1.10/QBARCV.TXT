      The QBARCV program is a routine that is CALLed from
a Quick Basic program. It creates a file called TEMPARC.DIR
which contains a verbose directory listing. If no drive and
path is specified, QBARCV will take advantage of an FilePath
utility.

Installation:
        QB yourprog/...;
        MASM QBARCV;
        LINK yourprog+QBARCV;

Usage:
        ARCNAME$="name of file"   'the extension defaults to .ARC
        RETCD%=0                  'a return code is placed here
                                  ' - zero if all okay
                                  ' - nonzero if any problems
        CALL ARCV (ARCNAME$,RETCD%)
        IF RETCD=0 THEN ...       'process TEMPARC.DIR now
