LP Command
________________

Purpose:  To print an  ASCII  file on a standard printer device
          at either 66 or 88 lines per page. A title is printed
          at the top of each page which contains the file name,
          creation date, and page number. Control codes are set
          for an HP LaserJet printer.

Syntax:   LP  [d][path]filename[.ext]   [/6][/8]
                                        [/L1][/L2]
                                        [/10][/12][/17]

Remarks:
	The default is 66 lines per page which results in
	an actual page text length of 60 lines. For 88 lines
	per page,
       	per page, specify the /8 option. This results in
	a page text length of 80 lines.

	The default printer is LPT1.  For LPT2, specify /L2.

	The default is 10 characters per inch.  For 12 cpi,
	specify /12; for 17 cpi, specify /17.  An appropriate
	font must be available.

	If the input filename is omitted, you are asked for it.

	Each page is numbered and contains a title consisting of
	the file name and creation date.  If a bold font is
	available, this top heading line has a weight of 3.

	The control codes can be changed for use with other
        printers.

        If a print spooler is used, DO NOT use LP while using the
        DOS PRINT command.

          Version 1.1, April 27, 1984.
          Version 1.2, Sept 12, 1984.
          Version 1.4, Aug 14, 1985.
              Because some print spoolers do not handle Int 17h
              this version uses function 21 to write to the printer.
              It is slower than 1.2.
          Version 1.6l, June 19, 1986.
              Modified for use with HP LaserJet printer
