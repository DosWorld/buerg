LP Command                                                      Version 1.8
----------                                                     Nov 13, 1988

Purpose:  To print an  ASCII  file on an HP LaserJet printer formatted
          with a title at the top of each page including the file
          name, creation time and date, and page number.  The file
          may be printed in either portrait or landscape mode, and
          options are available for selecting lines per inch, character
          pitch, margins, tab expansion, and font.

Syntax:   LP  [d][path]filename[.ext]   [/6][/8]
                                        [/L1][/L2][/L3]
                                        [/10][/12][/17]
|                                       [/OP][/OL]
|                                       [/Mn]
|                                       [/T4][/T8]
|                                       [/Fn]

Options:
          [/6][/8] - Select 6 or 8 lines per inch.
             Default is 6.  Resulting text page length depends on selected
             orientation.  Portrait (Landscape) mode at 6 lines per inch prints
             60 (42) lines per page, 8 lines per inch prints 80 (56) lines per
             page.

          [/L1][/L2][/L3] - Printer port select.  Default is L1 (LPT1).

          [/10][/12][/17] - Character pitch select.  Default is 10.
             Resulting characters per line, including margins, is dependent on
             the selected orientation.  The appropriate font must be available
             for the mode selected or the printer will substitute the closest
             available.

                            Characters per Line
                   cpi     Portrait     Landscape
                   ---     --------     ---------
                    10       80           106
                    12       96           127
                    17      132           176

        [/OP][/OL] - Selects portrait (OP) or landscape (OL) orientation.
                     Default is portrait.

        [/Mn] - Sets left margin at column n.  Default is column 0
             (first column).  Column numbering starts at 0, the maximum margin
             is 34.  Margin columns are set per the current fixed pitch
             selected (default is 10 cpi) even if a proportional font is
             selected for the text body.  Setting margins which cause excessive
             line wrapping may produce unpredictable results.

        [/T4][/T8] - Selects number of columns for tab expansion.
                     Default is 8.

        [/Fn] - Selects the font ID for the text body.  Default is none,
             and the fixed pitch font specified by the pitch option will be
             used.  Valid values are 0 to 32767.  A font
             (downloaded,resident,or cartridge) must be identified with a valid
             ID and specified as permanent prior to printing.  If the font
             specified is not defined, the current font will be used.

LP Command                                                      Version 1.8
----------                                                     Nov 13, 1988

Remarks:
        If the input filename is omitted, you will be prompted to supply
        one.

        Each page is numbered and contains a title consisting of the
        file name, creation time and date.  If 12 pt Helv is available
        it will be used for the title line, otherwise the current
        default font will be used.  If bold is available, it will be
        used on the title line.

        Consult the HP manual for information on specifying fonts with
        font ID numbers.  Only fonts identified as permanent will be
        accessable by the program.  Use of a proportional font for the
        text body does NOT change the character per line limit set with
        the pitch select option.

        This program contains control codes compatable with the HP
        LaserJet series of printers.  If desired the source can be
        changed to support other printers.

        If a print spooler is used, DO NOT use LP while using the DOS
        PRINT command.

Notes:
        Original program written by Vernon Buerg for the IBM PC using
        DOS 2.0 or later.  Version 1.7 additions by William B.  Franks.
        Free for personal use.  Not for sale or hire.

          Version 1.4, Aug 14, 1985.
              Because some print spoolers do not handle Int 17h
              this version uses function 21 to write to the printer.
              It is slower than 1.2.
          Version 1.6l, June 19, 1986.
              Modified for use with HP LaserJet printer
          Version 1.7, October 5, 1987.
              Added options for orientation, margins, and tabs.
