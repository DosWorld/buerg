LUU Command
-----------

Purpose:   Add or replace members in an LU or LAR type library.

Format:    LUU  [d:][path]filename[.ext] filename[.ext]

Remarks:   The library name and at input member file name must
           be supplied. Only one member name is allowed, so far.

           LUU duplicates the A(dd) and U(pdate) functions of LU.
           When used with LUT and LUE, original file dates are
           preserved and recorded.

           The advantages of LUU are:

                - smaller, so a copy can be kept on the "system" disk
                - faster, mucho
                - handles paths and wildcards
                - retains input file (or member) date/time
                - replaces in place (later)

Examples:
           LUU  a:AQM.LBR  b:*.AQM
           LUU PCT366.LBR b:PCT366.*
           LUU c:\test\source.lbr  b:ab??xx.*










File Formats:

               An LBR file consists of a directory and one or more
           "members". The directory contains from 4 to 256 entries.
           Each entry is 32 bytes long and describes a member, if
           one exists.

                The first directory entry describes the directory
           itself. Thus, the number of entries allocated is increased
           by one.

                All space allocation is in terms of sectors. Each
           sector is 128 bytes long. Four directory entries fit
           in one sector, so the directory is allocated in multiples
           of four.

                        Directory format
                        ----------------
                0 - File status; 0=active, 254=deleted, 255=free
                1 - Member name; filename in FCB format
               12 - Offset to data in sectors of 128 bytes
               14 - Length of member in sectors.
               16 - Original member file creation date, MM/DD/YY
               24 - Original member file creation time, HH:MM:SS


Press ENTER to continue: r file creation date, MM/DD/YY
               24 - Original member file creation time, HH:MM:SS
