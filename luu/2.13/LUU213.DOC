LUU Command
-----------

Purpose:   To place one or more files into a single library (LBR)
           file for archiving, data transmission or back-up.

Format:    LUU   [d:][path]filename[.LBR]  filespec(s) /N /Q /D /nnn

Remarks:   The library name and at least one input member file name
           must be supplied. The library name may contain a drive,
           path names, and a filename with an extension. If the
           library extension is omitted, .LBR is assumed.

           There may be one or more member file names. Separate each
           member name by one blank. Each member name may include a
           drive, path names, and wildcard characters in the file
           name and extension.

           Files larger than 1024 bytes are automatically sQueezed
           using the Greenlaw/Huffman algorithm. You may use the /N
           option to negate sQueezing. If the squeezed file is larger
           than the original file, an extra step is taken to place
           the smaller original file into the library. You may use
           the /Q option to bypass this step and put the squeezed
           version of the file into the library.

           The input files may be deleted (after being placed into
           the library file) by using the /D option.

           If the LBR file does not exist, you are prompted to enter
           a number for the size of the library directory. You may
           use the /nnn option to supply this number and avoid the
           prompt.

           The DOS error level is set to 1 if LUU terminates with an
           error.

           LUU duplicates the A(dd) and U(pdate) functions of LU.
           When used with LUT and LUE, original file dates are
           preserved and recorded.

           The advantages of LUU are:
             o  smaller, so a copy can be kept on the "system" disk
             o  faster, mucho
             o  handles paths and wildcards
             o  retains input file (or member) date/time
             o  replaces in-place to save disk space
             o  automatically squeezes files to save disk space

Command Options
---------------

        /N    indicates do Not squeeze the files, place the original
              files, as-is, into the library

        /Q    indicates that the sQueezed version of the files be
              placed into the library whether they are larger than
              the original version or not

        /D    indicates that the original files be deleted after
              being added to the library

        /nnn  supplies the number of directory to allocate to a
              new library, thus bypassing the prompt. A value of
              1 to 255 may be used.

        All command options must be entered after any filename
        parameters. That is, at the end of the command line.

        The defaults result in squeezing any file that is larger than
        1024 bytes, and placing the squeezed version of the file into
        the library only if it is smaller than the original file.


Examples
--------

        o  Place all files on drive B which have an extension
           of "AQM" into the file called "AQM.LBR":

                LUU a:AQM.LBR  b:*.AQM


        o  Place all files on drive B which have a filename
           of PCT366 into the file PCT366.LBR and do not sQueeze
           them:

                LUU PCT366 b:PCT366.* /N


        o  Place all files from drive B which match the file
           specification "AB??XX.???", and all files from the
           the directory "PROD" on drive A which have an extension
           of "ASC" into the file "SOURCE.LBR" in the directory
           called "TEST" on drive C:

                LUU c:\test\source.lbr  b:ab??xx.*  a:\prod\*.asc


        o  Place all files from the current drive into a new
           library called "TEST.LBR", and allocate 32 directory
           entries if the library does not exist:

                LUU test *.* /32

File Formats
------------

               An LBR file consists of a directory and one or more
           "members". The directory contains from 4 to 256 entries.
           Each entry is 32 bytes long and describes a member, if
           one exists.

                The first directory entry describes the directory
           itself. Thus, the number of entries allocated is increased
           by one.

                All space allocation is in terms of sectors. Each
           sector is 128 bytes long. Four directory entries fit
           in one sector, so the directory is allocated in multiples
           of four.

                There are three directory formats recognized by LUU.
           They are: 1) old LU, 2) LUPC, and 3) new LU86. When a new
           library is created, LUU uses the new LU86 directory format.
           If LUU is updating an existing LBR file, it uses the same
           format that the file was created with.

                        Directory format
                        ----------------
                0 - File status; 0=active, 254=deleted, 255=free
                1 - Member name; filename in FCB format, dir name is blanks
               12 - Offset to data in sectors of 128 bytes
               14 - Length of member in sectors.
               16 - all zero for 'old LU' format

                        LUPC format extension
                        ---------------------
                1 - master directory name is ********DIR
               16 - Original member file creation date, MM/DD/YY
               24 - Original member file creation time, HH:MM:SS

                        LU86 Directory Format
                        ---------------------

                0 - File status; 0=active, 254=deleted, 255=free
                1 - Member name; filename in FCB format, dir name is blanks
               12 - Offset to data in sectors of 128 bytes
               14 - Length of member in sectors.
               16 - CRC word, or zero if Cyclic Redundancy Checking not used
               18 - File create date, CP/M format
               20 - File create time, DOS format
               22 - Date file last updated (replaced), CP/M format
               24 - Time file last updated, DOS format
               26 - Number of bytes in last sector
               27 - reserved/unused/zero


           The date and time stamp fields vary in format. LUU uses
           the LU86 format when it creates a library. Otherwise, the
           format used when the library was created is used.

           The member name for the directory entry is all blanks.
           This allows for compatibility checking between versions
           of LU and LUU.
