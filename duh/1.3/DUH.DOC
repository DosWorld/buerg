DUH Command							 Version 1.3
-----------							 May 1, 1989

Function:  DUH deletes files that also exist in  ARC,  ZIP,
	   PAK,  LZH  and  most self-extracting EXE archive
	   files.  It is a common practice to extract files
	   in the same directory and end up with two copies
	   of things.  By using DUH, you can get rid of the
	   extracted files.


Usage:	   DUH	[d:\path\filespec]  [/O]  [/N]


Remarks:   The program uses  FV  to get a directory listing of
	   all archive files in the current directory. It then
	   compares the file names and datestamps to the files
	   in  the  directory specified  by  d:\path\filespec.
	   The default is all files, include archive files.

	   When the program finishes,  you have  a file called
	   DELINF.BAT.	It contains one ERASE command for each
	   duplicate  file;  followed  by  a  'del delinf.bat'
	   command to get rid of the  BAT  file.  You can edit
	   the	BAT  file to be more selective about the files
	   that are deleted.  Then, run DELINF to delete those
	   files.

	   Specify /O to delete older files.

	   Specify /N to delete files of the same name regardless
	   of the date stamps.

Notes:	   DUH was written in Quick Basic 3 (I was in a hurry) and
	   should run on all MS DOS version 2, or later, systems.
