Function:  DUH deletes files that also exist in ARC files.
           It is a common practice to unARC files in the same
           directory and end up with two copies of things. By
           using DUH, you can get rid of the extracted files.


Usage:     DUH  [d:\path\filespec]  [/O]  [/N]


Remarks:   The program uses ARCV to get a directory listing of
           all .ARC files in the current directory. It then
           compares the file names and datestamps to the files
           in the directory specified by d:\path\filespec. The
           default is all files that are not .ARC files in the
           current directory.

           When the program finishes, you have a file called
           DELINARC.BAT. It contains one ERASE command for each
           duplicate file; followed by a 'del delinarc.bat'
           command to get rid of the BAT file. You can edit the
           BAT file to be more selective about the files that
           are deleted. Then, run DELINARC to delete those files.

           Specify /O to delete older files.

           Specify /N to delete files of the same name regardless
           of the date stamps.

Notes:     DUH was written in Quick Basic 3 (I was in a hurry) and
           should run on all MS DOS version 2, or later, systems.
