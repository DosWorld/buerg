-----------

Purpose:   Extract one or more files (members) from an LU or LAR type library.

Format:    LUE  [d:][path]filename[.ext] [mbrname[.ext]]

Remarks:   The library name must be supplied. It may contain a drive
	   and/or path names, but may not contain wildcards.

	   If the member name is omitted, all files are extracted.

	   Wildcards may be used in the member name.

	   The output file names are taken from the member names.

	   The date and time of the output file(s) are set to the same
	   date and time as the input library file, unless they are
	   stored in the directory entry.

	   Directory entry format:
		0 - status flag
		1 - filename in FCB format
	       12 - offset to data
	       14 - length of data, 128-byte sectors
	       16 - creation date, MM-DD-YY
	       24 - creation time, HH:MM:SS

Examples:
	   - Extract all members from file TEST.LBR

		LUE B:TEST.LBR

	   - Extract all COM files from file PGM.LBR

		LUE PGM.LBR *.COM

	   LUE duplicates the A and E function of LU. The advantages
	   of LUE are:

	   - smaller, so a copy can be kept on the "system" disk
	   - faster, mucho
	   - handles paths and wildcards.
	   - retains input file or member date/time
