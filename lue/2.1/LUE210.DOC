LUE Command
-----------

Purpose:   Extract one or more files (members) from an LU or LAR type library.

Format:    LUE  [d:][path]filename[.LBR]  [mbrnames[.ext]]  [/X]

Remarks:   The library name must be supplied. It may contain a drive
           and/or path names, and may contain wildcards. Only the first
           matching library file is processed. If the extension is
           omitted, then an extension of .LBR is assumed.

           If the member name is omitted, all files are extracted. There
           may be as many member file names specified as will fit on a
           128-byte command line. Member filenames may contain wildcard
           characters (* and ?).

           Files with an extension that has a middle letter Q are
           considered "squeezed" files and they are expanded. Some
|          squeeze programs create files which are not in the original
|          Greenlaw (SQ, SQPC, and NSQ), or the SQ2 format. These files
|          are extracted without expansion.

|          To extract squeezed files without expanding them, use
|          the /X option.

           The output file names are taken from the member names and
           the extracted files are placed on the current drive and in
           the current directory.

           The date and time of the output file(s) are set to the same
           date and time as the input library file, unless the dates are
           stored in the LBR directory. If the file was originally
           sQueezed by SQPC or NSQ, the date is contained in the file
           and is not taken from the directory.

           Directory entry format:
                0 - status flag
                1 - filename in FCB format
               12 - offset to data
               14 - length of data, 128-byte sectors

             LUPC extension:

               16 - creation date, MM-DD-YY
               24 - creation time, HH:MM:SS

             LU86 extension:
               16 - see source for field definitions

Examples:
           - Extract all members from file TEST.LBR

                LUE B:TEST.LBR

           - Extract all COM files from file PGM.LBR

                LUE PGM.LBR *.COM

           - Extract member PROG.BAK from file SOURCE.LBR

                LUE C:\STUFF\SOURCE.LBR PROG.BAK

           - Extract all COM files from file TEST.LBR

                LUE B:\BACKUP.DSK\TEST *.COM

           LUE duplicates the A and E function of LU. The advantages
           of LUE are:

           - smaller, so a copy can be kept on the "system" disk
           - faster, mucho
           - handles paths and wildcards.
           - retains input file or member date/time
|          - compatible with most forms of LBR files: LU, LU86, LAR, LUPC
|          - expands sQueezed files in the SQ, SQPC, NSQ and SQ2 formats
