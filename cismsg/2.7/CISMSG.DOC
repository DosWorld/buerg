 Command CISMSG 					    Version 2.7
 -------------- 					    Dec 21, 1988

Purpose:

	CISMSG copies a file which contains CompuServe (CIS) messages to
	a new file with the messages in subject or number order.

Format:

	CISMSG	[d:][path]infile[.ext]	[d:][path]outfile[.ext]
		[/nn]  [/M]  [/S[/X]]

Remarks:

	Records are read from the  file named by 'infile' and  copied to
	the file  named by  'outfile'.  Records  must end  in a carriage
	return or  linefeed, and  must be  less than  255 characters  in
	length.  The 'infile'  file name is  required.  If omitted,  the
	'outfile' name  defaults to  'MESSAGES.ALL', or  to the 'infile'
	name if just a drive for the output is supplied.

	Tab characters should not be present in the input file.

	The records are  sorted into section  and subject order,  unless
	the /M option is used to specify that the messages be sorted  in
	message number order.

	Any  superfluous  data,  such  as  bulletins, become part of the
	preceding message.  Duplicate messages are skipped only if  they
	are identical.

	All available memory is used.  A maximum of 64K is used for  I/O
	buffers.  Half of  the available memory  is used for  containing
	message data.  Each message requires 32 bytes.

	Depending on the amount of memory available, up to 10000 records
	may be ordered.  Neither the  size of the file, nor  the lengths
	of messages, affects the maximum number of messages that can  be
	processed.

	For  best  performance,  place	the  input  message  file on the
	fastest disk drive, e.g.  RAM disk.

			Splitting message files
			-----------------------

	Messages from a single section may be selected by using the  /nn
	option.  Specify a one or  two digit section number in	place of
	the nn.

	Messages may be split into one file for each section by using the
	/S (separate output) option. The output file name extension becomes
	the section number, for example:

		CISMSG ibmcomm.ato com /s

	produces files COM01, COM02, etc, and

		CISMSG ibmcomm.ato com. /s

	produces files with a numeric extension like COM.01, COM.02, etc.

	You may use the /X option with /S to reverse the filename and
	extension for the output filename. For example, say you have a
	file of messages called IBMAPPM.ATO, and you;d like it in separate
	section files with the same extension of A02 and a filename that
	is the section number:

		CISMSG26 IBMAPPM.ATO XX.A02 /S/X

	will create files 01.A02, 02.A02, etc.

			Examples
			--------

	o Sort the  messages from file	IBMSW.719 on drive  A, to a  new
	  file called IBMSW.XXX on drive B

		CISMSG A:IBMSW.719 B:IBMSW.XXX


	o Sort messages in file IBMSW.MON which is on the current drive,
	  and copy to a new files called IBMSW.MON on drive B

		CISMSG IBMSW.MON B:


	o Select section 8 messages from file IBMNEW.MSG

		CISMSG IBMNEW.MSG IBMNEW.8 /8


	o Sort the messages in the file IBMSWM.ATO by message number:

		CISMSG IBMSWM.ATO IBMSW.MSG /M


	o Sort the messages in the file IBMCOMM.ATO into separate  files
	  for each section.  The output files are named IBMCOM.nn where
	  'nn' is the section number.

		CISMSG IBMCOMM.ATO IBMCOM /S
