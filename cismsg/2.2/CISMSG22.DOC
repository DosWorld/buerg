CISMSG Command
--------------

Purpose:   This program copies a file containing CIS messages into
           a new file with the messages in subject or number order.

Format:
|          CISMSG  [d:][path]fname[.ext]  [d:][path]fname[.ext]
|                  [/n]  [/M]

Remarks:   Records read from the input file ending with a carriage
           return and line feed are considered logical records and
           may be up to 255 characters in length.

           Tab characters should not be present in the input file.

           Messages from a single section may be selected by using
           the /n option. Specify a one or two digit section number
           in place of the n.

           The  records are sorted into section and subject order,
|          unless  the  /M  option  is  used  to  specify that the
|          messages be sorted in message number order.

           Any superfluous data, such as bulletins, become part of
           the preceding message.  Duplicate  messages are skipped
           only if they are identical.

           All available memory is used. A maximum of 64K is  used
           for I/O buffers.  Half of the available memory  is used
           for containing message data. Each message  requires  32
           bytes.

           Depending  on the  amount of  memory  available,  up to
           10000 records may be ordered.  Neither the  size of the
           file, nor the lengths of messages,  affects the maximum
           number of messages that can be processed.

           For best performance, place the input message  file  on
           the fastest disk drive, e.g. RAM disk.

Examples:
           - Sort the messages from file IBMSW.719 on drive A,  to
             a new file called IBMSW.XXX on drive B

                CISMSG A:IBMSW.719 B:IBMSW.XXX

           - Sort messages in file IBMSW.MON which is on the current
             drive, and copy to a new files called IBMSW.MON on drive B

                CISMSG IBMSW.MON B:

           - Supply the file names by using prompts

                CISMSG
                Enter INPUT file name-  A:IBMSW.719
                Enter OUTPUT file name- C:

           - Select section 8 messages from file IBMNEW.MSG

                CISMSG IBMNEW.MSG IBMNEW.8 /8

|          - Sort the messages in the file IBMSWM.ATO by message number:
|
|               CISMSG IBMSWM.ATO IBMSW.MSG /M
