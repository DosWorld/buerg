                     BRO - Browse library catalogs offline


         Function:

         BRO allows you to view forum library catalogs, either
         complete library catalogs, "short" library catalogs or IBMNET
         summary files, search for files of interest thru a variety of
         means, and generate an Autosig script for fast downloading of
         those files you've selected.


         Syntax:

         BRO [forum.lib]

         where "forum" is the exact forum name, 1 to 7 characters
         and where "lib" is a number from 0 to 17

         This information is if omitted, you are prompted for the
         forum name, etc.

         Input:

         The DL catalog file is created by capturing the output of
         a CAT /DES command while online or by downloading a forum
         prepared summary file.

         Output:

         A file called "DL.SCR" is created if any entries are M)arked.
         This file is in ATO script file format and may be invoked in
         ATO to automatically download the files you've marked.

         Catalog file structure:

         #1 - transaction file; capture of CAT/DES, or .SUM file input
         #2 - optional .SCR script output file
         #3 - data for DL/LIB entries (.DAT)
         .INX - index to .DAT entries

         BRO data files:

         Prior to starting BRO you should have a library catalog
         available to you. BRO accepts catalogs in five formats.
         Because of the large number of formats supported this might
         be a little tricky at first, so hang in there!

         Files are loaded by selecting menu entries 1 through 5 from
         the main BRO screen.

         1) Add to catalog from CAT/DES capture file (NEW). This
         format is the "new" library format introduced in the PRACTICE
         forum on 9/4/91. Use this format if the format catalog is in
         "long" format and is in the "new" format. If you're unsure
         ask a sysop and they'll be glad to let you know what format a
         forums library is in.

         2) Add to catalog from CAT/DES capture file (OLD). This is
         the "old" library format. As of 9/4/91 this format was being
         phased out but you'll probably find it in forums for at least
         the next two months. Again, feel free to ask a sysop if a
         forums file is in the "new" or "old" format.

         3) Update catalog from IBMNET format summary files.  IBMNET
         summary files are one line entries of library files and can
         be found in library 0 of most IBMNET forums (all except
         PCVEN* and SHARE).  The name of the summary file changes
         depending on the forum but BRO /KEY=SUMMARY will always
         display it.

         4) Load catalog from LIB DIR /SHORT capture file (NEW). This
         is the library "short" format that was introduced in the
         PRACTICE forum on 9/4/91.

         5) Load catalog from LIB DIR /SHORT capture file (OLD). This
         is the library "short" format that has been in use for a
         period of time. Again, if you're unsure of the library format
         don't hesitate to ask the sysop.


         If you're unsure of how to create a catalog there are a
         number of methods available and most forums have prepared
         catalogs in compressed format. However if you're interested
         in the mechanics the command:

         CAT /DES

         from a library prompt will give you files in non-stop mode.

         Prepared catalogs are available in most IBMNET forums in
         library 0

         Like the summary files the names of the files change but
         they are the "quick reference word" names for each forum;
         that is for IBMCOM the filename is IBMCOM.ARC.


         Other BRO functions:


         In addition to the catalog loading options you'll find the
         following functions:

                 --------------------------------------------

                     (B)  Browse current ATO catalog
                     (D)  Download selected files
                     (S)  Sort catalog by forum, DL,
                          filename
                     (K)  Delete current ATO catalog

                     (Q)  Quit, return to DOS

                     ¯ ®  Select one

                 --------------------------------------------


         The first time you use BRO you'll need to add a catalog from
         a library capture (discussed above) or from a summary file.

         Browsing files:

         When you select the B(rowse) function you'll receive a
         display of the first file in the catalog. The format is as
         follows:


                                 A U T O S I G
                             --------------------
                             Browse Forum Catalog
                  Forum: IBMNEW                       DL:  1

         [76703,750]
         LIB.HLP             [SEL] 31-Jul-88  30290              1371

         Keywords:  LIB LIBRARY DATABASE PROGRAMS FILES DOWNLOAD HELP

         Everything you need to know in order to download from the
         Libraries.  Explains how to use the various protocols, the
         various types of files (ARC, etc.), how to set your CIS
         "defaults", how to find files of interest and some solutions
         to common problems.  Please leave a message for the SysOps if
         you have any problems.  To get this file just use the <R>ead
         command and capture to disk, a protocol DOWnload is not
         necessary.  [Rev. 5/88, previous count = 9947].

      Enter  Home End  M)ark O)mit  C)omments  F)ind A)gain  Q)uit ?


         In this example the file has been M)arked and the [SEL]
         "flag" to the file of the filename indicates that it has been
         selected for download.

         BRO keys:

         The up and down arrow keys move forward or backward one file
         at a time.

         The home key takes you to the top of the file.

         The M key marks a file for downloading.

         The O key unmarks a file that has been selecting for
         downloading.

         The C (comment) key is not implemented at this time.

         The F (find) key allows you to search for a specific string.
         Case is not significant.

         The A (again) key allows you to repeat a find.

         The Q (quit) key terminates the BRO session and returns you
         to the main menu.

         Generating a download script:

         After marking files for download Q(uit) the current marking
         session and return to the main menu and select the Download
         Selected Files function. This will generate a script to
         download the files. In addition to filenames and library
         locations "GO" words for forums will be generated as well.
         The script will be named DL.SCR.

         Note: The Download function overwrites any previous DL.SCR
         files!

         At the time the DL.SCR file is created the [SEL] flag on any
         selected file is changed to [DOW] (so you know that you've
         downloaded it!).

         Executing the script:

         From Autosig on-line mode hit Alt-T and reply DL to the
         script name prompt. DL.SCR will log you onto the first forum
         in the DL.SCR script, select the first library, download the
         file(s) and continue to other libraries and other forums. BRO
         automatically inserts a logoff at the end of the script. If
         you wish you may edit the script and pass off DL.SCR to an
         ATO auto pass. Any text editor or word processor that will
         produce standard ascii files will work just fine for
         modifying the script.

         Cautions:

         The actual download syntax is:

         DOW FILENAME.EXT[USER_ID]

         Legal and other stuff:

         This program is, of course, offered as is.  We can't
         guarantee it will work on every permutation of equipment.  We
         will make an honest effort to correct and/or add any features
         that you ask for.  If you do have a problem please be sure
         and let us know. Because of the large number of formats
         supported in this version there will undoubtly be some
         confusion so please don't hestiate to drop by IBMCOM and let
         us know if you've run into a glitch.
