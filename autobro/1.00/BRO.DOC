 Name:
       BRO, version 1, Vernon Buerg, Copyright 1988.

 Function:
       Create an ATO script file to download files selected
       from a forum DL catalog file listing.

 Syntax:
       BRO [forum.dl]

       where "forum" is the exact forum name, 1 to 7 characters
       this must be the Compuserve 'quick reference word' for the forum.
             "dl" is a number from 0 to 17
       if omitted, the user is prompted for the forum name, etc.


 Input:
       The DL catalog file is created by capturing the output of
       a CAT /DES command while online.

       To create a catalog paging should be disabled either via
       options in the GO TERMINAL section or by typing SET PAGE OFF
       at the data library prompt.

       A capture file should be opened and then the command CAT /DES
       can be used to generate a non-stop listing of files and descriptions.
       The one line summary file format is not supported at this time.

 Output:
       A file called "DL.SCR" is created if any entries are M)arked.
       The user may then invoke ATO with the following:
               ATO /XDL
       to automatically log on and download those files.

       The script file can also be invoked if ATO is on-line via the
       Atl-T key and replying DL.

  Cautions:
       DL.SCR is NOT overwritten by your next session. You must delete
       the DL.SCR file prior to running your next script generating
       session!!

       The scripts will get confused if there is more than one file
       with the same filename. This condition is not common but can
       happen.
