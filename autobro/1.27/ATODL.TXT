ATODL generates download scripts for AutoSig.  Unlike other script
generators, uses ATO's configuration file for information about hosts,
forums, and sections.

Currently, ATODL only creates download scripts.  Future versions may have
other capabilities.

Syntax:
          ATODL [<filename>]
     
     where <filename> is the name of a script file.  If no extension is
     provided, .SCR is used.  If <filename> is omitted, ATODL writes output
     to ATODL.SCR.

Instructions:
-------------

ATODL prompts for a host name, then a forum name, then a library number,
then a file name.

This process repeats, allowing you to download files from multiple
libraries within multiple forums.  A typical session would look like:

<host>
     <forum>
          <lib>
               <file>
               <file>
               <file>
          <lib>
               <file>
               <file>
     <forum>
          <lib>
               <file>
               <file>
     <forum>
          <lib>
               <file>

Back out at each level by pressing ENTER; ATODL will return to the previous
level.

Execute the script by typing ATO /Xatodl.
