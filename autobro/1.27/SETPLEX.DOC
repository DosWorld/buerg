SETPLEX.SCR

I found that when I tried to use Jamie Clay's SETUP.SCR to set the easyplex
options it didn't work as the easy plex options do not follow the pattern of
the forum options menus.

To set your options in Easyplex set up the forun options in ATO by using F3. 
Use the same settings as for other forums but answer yes to the stay on line
question.  Then G)o online to Easyplex.

At the Easyplex first prompt press ALT-T and answer SETPLEX when asked for your
script.  Your Easyplex options will be set automatically for you and when
finished you will be left at the Easyplex prompt.

Either visit any other Forum or service or you can logoff the system.
