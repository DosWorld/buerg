                               Version 1.26d

         Function:

         BRO allows you to view forum library catalogs, either
         complete catalogs or IBMNET summary files, search for files
         of interest thru a variety of methods, and generate an Autosig
         script for fast downloading of those files you've selected.


         Syntax:

         BRO [forum.dl]

         where "forum" is the exact forum name, 1 to 7 characters
             "dl" is a number from 0 to 17
         if omitted, you are prompted for the forum name, etc.

         Input:

         The DL catalog file is created by capturing the output of
         a CAT /DES command while online.

         Output:

         A file called "DL.SCR" is created if any entries are M)arked and
         the D)ownload function is selected from the main screen. Any previous
         DL.SCR files are overwritten.

         Catalog file structure:

         #1 - transaction file; capture of CAT/DES, or .SUM file input
         #2 - optional .SCR script output file
         #3 - data for DL/LIB entries (.DAT)
         .INX - index to .DAT entries

         SORTF.COM and SORTF.DOC are also included in the distribution file.
         SORTF.COM is used for sorting the BRO database and must be in the
         current directory or in your path.

         While not needed for operation of BRO check out the docs for SORTF
         as you might find other uses for it. It's highly flexible and an
         excellent replacement for the DOS SORT program.

         BRO data files:

         Prior to starting BRO you should have a library catalog
         available to you. BRO accepts catalogs in two formats:

         IBMNET summary file format. Summary files are one line
         entries of library files and can be found in library 0 of
         most IBMNET forums (all except PCVENx and IBMJR). The name of
         the summary file changes depending on the forum but BRO
         /KEY=SUMMARY will always display it.

         Full catalog files. These are catalogs that are created if
         you use a SCA /DES command (for non-stop, or, if you will, if
         you were BROwsing a file). The command:

         SCA /DES

         will give you files in non-stop mode or you can download the
         files in compressed format in library 0 of each IBMNET forum.
         Like the summary files the names of the files change but
         they are the "quick reference word" names for each forum;
         that is for IBMCOM the filename is IBMCOM.ZIP.

         If you're not familar with how to manually catalog a library
         please consult the file LIB.HLP in the Download Help library (lib 1)
         of IBMNEW.

         BRO is also compatible with the output of DLSCAN which is located
         in the Autosig library (lib 1) of IBMCOM. DLSCAN is an ATO script
         generator like BRO that will catalog a single library or multiple
         libraries, via a script, on a number of criteria. High recommended.

         Starting BRO:

         If you start BRO without any arguments you'll get the
         following menu:

                     (Q)  Quit, return to DOS

                     ¯ ®  Select one

                 --------------------------------------------


         The first time you use BRO you'll need to add a catalog from
         a library capture (discussed above) or from a summary file.
         If you're using a full catalog file select the (A)dd
         function.  If you'll be using a summary file select the
         (U)pdate function.

         Important note: Do NOT attempt to use both summary files AND
         full catalog files. This will cause confusion.

         When you select (A) or (U) you'll receive the following
         screen:


                                 A U T O S I G
                             --------------------
                             Browse Forum Catalog
             Forum:                                           DL:

                          File name :
                          Forum name:
                          DL number :

                          Press PgDn when ready.
                          Press ESCape to abort.



         The file name entry should be the name of the file that
         contains the catalog (IBMCOM.CAT or whatever). The forum name
         entry is critical; it should be the same name as the forum
         name set up in Autosig. The library number can be set to
         0 if the library number is embedded in the catalog, otherwise
         use the starting library number of your catalog.

         Browsing files:

         When you select the B(rowse) function you'll receive a
         display of the first file in the catalog. The format is as
         follows:


                                 A U T O S I G

         Keywords:  LIB LIBRARY DATABASE PROGRAMS FILES DOWNLOAD HELP

         Everything you need to know in order to download from the
         Libraries.  Explains how to use the various protocols, the
         various types of files (ARC, etc.), how to set your CIS
         "defaults", how to find files of interest and some solutions
         to common problems.  Please leave a message for the SysOps if
         you have any problems.  To get this file just use the <R>ead
         command and capture to disk, a protocol DOWnload is not
         necessary.  [Rev. 5/88, previous count = 9947].

      Enter  Home End  M)ark O)mit  C)omments  F)ind A)gain  Q)uit ?


         In this example the file has been M)arked and the [SEL]
         "flag" to the file of the filename indicates that it has been
         selected for download.

         BRO keys:

         The up and down arrow keys move forward or backward one file
         at a time.

         The home key takes you to the top of the file.

         The M key marks a file for downloading.

         The O key unmarks a file that has been selecting for
         downloading.

         The C (comment) key is not implemented at this time.

         The F (find) key allows you to search for a specific string.
         Case is not significant.

         The A (again) key allows you to repeat a find.

         The Q (quit) key terminates the BRO session and returns you
         to the main menu.

         Generating a download script:

         After marking files for download Q(uit) the current marking
         session and return to the main menu and select the Download
         Selected Files function. This will generate a script to
         download the files. In addition to filenames and library
         locations "GO" words for forums will be generated as well.
         The script will be named DL.SCR.

         Note: The Download function overwrites any previous DL.SCR
         files!

         At the time the DL.SCR file is created the [SEL] flag on any
         selected file is changed to [DOW] (so you know that you've
         downloaded it!).

         Executing the script:

         From Autosig on-line mode hit Alt-T and reply DL to the
         script name prompt. DL.SCR will log you onto the first forum
         in the DL.SCR script, select the first library, download the
         file(s) and continue to other libraries and other forums. BRO
         automatically inserts a logoff at the end of the script. If
         you wish you may edit the script and pass off DL.SCR to an
         ATO auto pass. Any text editor or word processor that will
         produce standard ascii files will work just fine for
         modifying the script.

         Cautions:

         The actual download syntax for a complete catalog is:

         DOW FILENAME.EXT[USER_ID]

         As the user id of the uploader isn't carried in a summary file
         this information is not available.

         Thus if there are two files of the same name the library software
         will display the filenames and ask for a selection.  DL.SCR is not
         capable of handling this condition.

         Legal and other stuff:

         This program is, of course, offered as is.  We can't
         guarantee it will work on every permutation of equipment.  We
         will make an honest effort to correct and/or add any features
         that you ask for.  If you do have a problem please be sure
         and let us know.
