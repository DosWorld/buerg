This is a self-extracting archive of IBMNET's free CompuServe front-end
communications program, called AUTOSIG.  This particular archive, 
packaged for ASP, contains not only the basic AUTOSIG program and
documentation, but all of the add-on products, as well, including the
latest released versions of each.

If you type "Y" at the prompt, the following files will be extracted from
the archive into your current directory.  After extraction, type
"AUTOSIG" at the DOS prompt to get going.  The users manual is
AUTOSIG.DOC.  For technical support 24 hours a day, join us in the 
IBM Communications Forum (IBMCOM), AUTOSIG Section 1.
