  AUTODATE
  ========
     The AUTODATE program maintains a date file which is used to supply
     the date and time for the system after a System Restart is performed.
     There are two files involved:
           AUTODATE.DAT  - The Date file, required
           AUTODATE.COM  - Assembled and linked, executable module

     The date file is named AUTODATE.DAT and consists of two records, one
     with the current date in the form MM-DD-YYYY, and the second with the
     current time in the form HH:MM:SS. The program does not create the
     date file, so use EDLIN (or similar program) to allocate it.

     When the program is invoked, it obtains the current date and time
     from DOS. If the date is 01-01-1980, a power-on is assumed and a new
     date and time is read from the DAT file. Otherwise, the current DOS
     values are used. To run the program after System Restart, place the
     command AUTODATE into the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

     The user is prompted for the date and time, just as if the DATE and
     TIME commands had been used. Pressing the ENTER key tells the program
     to use the displayed value. An incorrect value (bad syntax, etc)
     generates an error message and a new prompt. Control-break can be used
     to exit the program. Supply the date/time values with leading digits.
                  Enter new date: 11-02-1983
                  Enter new time: 12:15:30

     A useful feature of this program is its forgiving nature (simple minded).
     Either the DATE and/or TIME may be supplied with only one digit. For
     example,
                 Enter new date:  11-02
                 Enter new time:  12:20

     and thereby cut down on key strokes a bit. Leading zeros must be entered.
