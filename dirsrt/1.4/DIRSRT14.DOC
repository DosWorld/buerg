---------------                                                 August 10, 1992

Purpose:  To sort the directory (DIR) file used by AUNTIE and PCBoard.

Usage:    DIRSRT  dir-name  output-filename  [/D | /P]
                  [DIR]     [DIRSRT]         [/C]
                                             [/ca]

        The 'dir-name' is optional. It may include drive and
        path. The default is DIR.

        The 'output-filename' is optional. It may include a
        drive, path, and filename. If omitted, a file name
        of DIRSRT is used.

        The /D option specifies that the directory be sorted
        in descending order by date for Auntie. Use /P for
        PCBoard directory formats.

        The /C option specifies that the directory be sorted
        by the two character category field. The default sort
        order is by filename. You may use only one of the /C
        and /D options.

        To select only those file entries belonging to a
        category, supply the '/ca' switch with the two letter
        category, e.g. /GA to select all GA files. Be sure the
        letters are upper case if they are upper case in the
        directory file.

        Approximately 128K is required. At least 32 bytes per
        file entry is needed, plus 32k for file buffers.
