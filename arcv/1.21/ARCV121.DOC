                      ARCV - Verbose ARC Directory Lister
                           Version 1.21 - Mar 6, 1989



Purpose:  To display the names and attributes of files contained
          within an ARC archive file. This is identical to the
          V function of the ARC program which produces a verbose
          directory listing.


Format:   ARCV  [d:][path]filespec[.ARC]  [/p] [/z] [/b] [>outfile]


Notes:    If no operands are entered, a display of the program's
          command format is displayed.

          The drive and path are optional. The filespec may contain
          the wildcard cahracters * and ?. All files matching the
          file specification are processed.

          If the filespec extension is omitted, the extension .ARC
          is used.

|         Use the /p parameter to pause the display when the screen
|         fills.

|         Use the /z parameter to list all file entries in an sub-
|         directory files created by ARC version 6.00 or later.

|         Use the /b parameter to suppress the d:\path information
|         in the display.

Examples:

        o  Display the directory of the TEST.ARC file, in the current
           directory:

                ARCV TEST

        o  Display the directories of all ARC files, but redirect the
           information to the file ARC.DIR:

                ARCV * >ARC.DIR

        o  Print the directory of the file NUBIES.ARC in directory RTEST
           on drive A:

                ARCV A:\RTEST\NUBIES >LPT1:
