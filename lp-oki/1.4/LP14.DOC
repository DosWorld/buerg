LP Command
________________

Purpose:  To print an  ASCII  file on a standard printer device
	  at either 66 or 88 lines per page. A title is printed
	  at the top of each page which contains the file name,
	  creation date, and page number.

Syntax:	  LP  [d][path]filename[.ext]	[/6][/8]
					[/L1][/L2]
					[/10][/12][/17]

Remarks:  The default is 88 lines per page. For	66 lines per
	  page,	specify	the /6 option.

	  The default printer is LPT1. For LPT2, specify /L2.

	  The default is 12 CPI. For 10, specify /10; for 17,
	  specify /17.

	  If the input filename	is omitted, you	are asked for it.

	  Each page is numbered	and contains a title consisting
	  of the file name and creation	date.

	  Control characters sent to the OKI printer include
	  TAB settings.	The control codes can be changed for
	  use with other printers.

	  If a print spooler is	used, DO NOT use LP while using
	  the DOS PRINT	command.

	  Written by Vernon Buerg for the IBM PC using DOS 2.0

	  Version 1.1, April 27, 1984.
	  Version 1.2, Sept 12, 1984.
          Version 1.4, Aug 14, 1985.
              Because some print spoolers do not handle Int 17h
              this version uses function 21 to write to the printer.
              It is slower than 1.2.
