--------------                                                  August 10, 1987


Purpose:

    LJBOOK prints  text documents  in a  book format.   There are four pages
    printed on each sheet of paper; two pages on each side of the paper.  An
    HP LaserJet is required.  The  Y cartridge font is recommended,  but any
    font capable of line printer, landscape, 8.5 point print may be used.

Syntax:

    LJBOOK  filename  [output]  [/f]  [/p]  [/d]

Remarks:

    The 'filename' is  required.  It specifies  the name of  the file to  be
    printed.  A drive and/or path name may be used.

    The 'output'  file name  is optional.   If omitted,  the standard output
    printer device is used, i.e.   LPT1: or PRN: devices.  If  supplied, the
    output is written to the specfied file instead of to the printer.

    There are two pages printed on each of the two sides of the paper.  Each
    side consists of a title line and up to 66 lines of 80 characters  each.

    Eighty characters are printed on  each line.  If the file's lines exceed
    80 characters, the lines are  wrapped so that 80 characters  are printed
    on each line until the entire file's line has been processed.

    A new page  is started after  66 lines have  been printed, or  if a form
    feed (hex 0C) is encounterd.

    After the first side has been printed, remove the printed paper from the
    stacker and place it into the paper tray.  The orientation of the  paper
    in the tray depends  on the printer model  and method of stacking  used.

    On a LaserJet Plus with the  standard paper stacker, the paper is  moved
    from the stacker to the tray without rotating or turning.

    Specify /p to generate page numbering  and to place the page numbers  at
    the top of each page.

    Specify /d to add the current date and time to the top of each page.

    Specify /f to place the file's name at the top of each page.

    TAB control characters are NOT expanded.

    PC DOS version 2.0 or later is required.  About 64k of memory is needed.
    For personal use only. May not be sold.
