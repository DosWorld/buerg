TABS Command
-----------------

Purpose:   Replace blanks with TAB character(s); or expand TABs.

Format:    TABS  [d:][\path]infile [d:][\path]    [/D]
                                   [d:][outfile]

Remarks:   Any TAB characters found are first expanded. If TABS
        appear within quoted strings - out of context - they will
        not be expanded. Trailing blanks are deleted.

        The /D option may be used to remove TABs from a file,

        The input file name must be supplied. It may include a
        drive and/or path name. If the output file name is
        omitted, the input file name, current drive, and current
        directory are used.

        Each filename may contain drive and path specifications.
        Wildcards are allowed with the input filename only. All
        files matching the input specification are processed.
        The output file may be a drive and path, or a drive and
        filename, but not path and filename.

        If any errors are encountered, the ERRORLEVEL variable is
        set to a 1 (one).

        The maximum logical record size is 255, see MAXREC equate.
        Defacto tab columns are 9,17,25,...

        A>

 o  Put tabs in all files with an extension of DOC from drive A in
    the subdirectory named SOURCE, to directory TEST on drive B:

        A>TABS A:\SOURCE\*.DOC B:\TEST

 o  Copy file MEMO.TXT as MEMO2.TXT and put in tabs:

        A>TABS MEMO.TXT MEMO2.TXT

 o  Remove tabs from file TEST.ASM on drive C and place the new file
    on drive B:

        A>TABS C:TEST.ASM B: /D


Notes:  Version 1.6 - June 17, 1984
         o  includes a correction for the use of wildcards
            to name the output file the same as the input file if
            only a drive was supplied for the output file name.

        Version 1.7 - March 2, 1985
         o  processes all input files which match the input file
            specification
         o  treats the EOF character as end of file, thus embedded
            EOF characters will result in a truncated file

        Version 1.8 - April 13, 1985
         o  The input file specification is now required,
         o  The output file specification may include a path OR
            a file name, but not both.
         o  Set DOS ERRORLEVEL to 1 if any errors.

        Version 1.9 - June 5, 1985
         o  The output file specification is required unless the
            input file specification has a drive. This prevents
            over-writing the input file.

|       Version 2.0 - March 5, 1986
|        o  Add EOF to end of file for programs that need it.
|        o  Improve performance about 10%.
