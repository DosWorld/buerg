 Command  LIST
 -------------

 Purpose:  To display the contents of an ASCII text file,  line by  line
           with the aid of scrolling and positioning commands.

 Format:   LIST  [d:][path]filename[.ext]

 Remarks:  An ASCII file of any size may be listed.

|          The "filename" is optional.  If omitted, you are prompted  to
|       to enter  a filename.   You may  include drive,  path, and  wild
|       cards in the file name.   The first file which matches  the name
|       is displayed until an end-of-file character is encountered.

           LIST was  designed to  display ASCII  files.  That  is, files
        which  contain  text  and  not  binary  or  control codes.  Text
        characters usually range from a value of 32 to 127.

           Characters  below  32  (a  blank)  are  replaced with a funny
        character to indicate that a non-displayable character has  been
        encountered.  This character is an upside-down question mark.

           Characters above 127 may be valid graphic characters, and may
        be displayed if  the '8' command  is in effect.   To insure that
        characters above ASCII value 127 are not displayed, use the  '7'
        command.

           The  file  is  displayed  with  one  logical  record  on each
        80-column display line.   A logical record  ends in a  linefeed.
        The maximum logical record may  be 255 characters long.  If  the
        record exceeds 80  characters, you may  view the portion  beyond
        the 80 columns  by using the  scroll right command,  or by using
        the Wrap feature.

           The Wrap  command toggles  ON or  OFF the  wrapping of  lines
        longer than 80 characters.  With Wrap on, lines are displayed in
        their  entirety,  80  characters  per  display line.  The scroll
        -left and -right functions are disabled when Wrap is ON.

           The file may  be PRINTed as  it it displayed.   The P command
        toggles  the  printer  on  or  off.   When  first entered, the P
        command causes the current screen  to be printed.  As new  lines
        are displayed, they too are printed.  Printing may be stopped by
        entering another P command.  The PrtSc key may also be used, but
        the title and prompt lines will be printed with the lines of the
        file.

 Restrictions
 ------------

           All positioning is relative to the current block in  storage.
        The size of the block depends on the amount of memory available,
        and up to 64K-bytes is allocated to the file buffer. The program
        requires at least 4K bytes.

        PC-DOS Version 2.0 or later is required.

        ANSI.SYS is NOT required.
                                                                 LIST     Page 2

 Scanning for text
 -----------------

           To scan for a character string, type a slash (/) followed  by
        one or more (up to 32)  characters.  The scan text, but not  the
        slash,  is  displayed  on  the  command  line.  The scan is case
        sensitive.  That is, lower case scan text will only match  lower
        lower case file text.

|          While  the  program  is  searching  for  the text, the bottom
|       display line is changed to say "Scanning".

           If the text is found, the line containing it is displayed  as
        a high-intensity line.

           If the text is NOT found, the bottom line (25) is changed  to
        say '*** text not found ***', and the display remains unchanged.

 Screen attributes
 -----------------

           There are three classes  of attributes used.  One  for normal
        display lines  - lines  2 to  24 -  another for  special lines -
        lines 1 and 25, and a third for the background color.

        These attributes may be changed by using DEBUG:

|        at offset 13C = 09     ;special lines, hi-lighted or lt.blue
|        at offset 13D = 02     ;normal lines, green
|        at offset 13F = 07     ;background, black

        If these values don't match, you have a different version.
