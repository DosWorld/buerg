I. LIST and Windows 95 tip:

 1. Create a shortcut to LIST and put this shortcut into the directory
    "\windows\send to".
 2. Set the properties of the shortcut so that it closes the DOS box on
    exit.
 3. Now, in Explorer, right click the mouse on any file (or directory),
    and click on the "Send to" entry.  A list of places to send the file
    to appears, including LIST.  Select LIST and instantly a windows
    appears, running LIST and showing the file.  On pressing ESC the
    window vanishes.

II. Enhanced video modes, e.g. 132 by 25, can be used with LIST under
    Windows 95.
