  - Plus: clean up a-v displays with split screen
- 7.420 06/22/90
  - optimize allocation of internal tables to allowing viewing even when there's not enough memory; a-x and a-g are disabled first to try for enough memory; then, the maximum file size viewable is decreased until there is enough memory; approximately 1K is required for each 1mb of file size, the current limit is 16mb, but can be increased to 400mb or more; a DEBUG patch for the file size limit will be supplied later, or just included in the ADN setup program.

  - Corrected exiting cursor after alt-E.
  - After toggling the 25/43(50) line mode with alt-E, a VGA was displaying line 25 a couple of lines above the bottom line. This has been fixed.
  - The continuous scroll rate was too fast for some users. The default scroll rate is now the slowest possible. To increase the rate, press the minus (-) key twice to get the fastest rate, or press the plus key (and hold it down) until you get the faster rate that you want. You can then clone (alt-C) this rate for future use.
  - When using P to print a screen, pressing any key wasn't stopping the printer like 62a was. This has been corrected.
  - Corrected the inability to accept one digit line numbers.
  - Changing or invoking a filter repositioned the display to line 1. This was done because the number of lines in the file may have changed and the position became invalid. The `7, 8, *`, and alt-T (tab) filters now resume the display at the same line number. The alt-J and Wrap filters still restart the display at line 1.
  - When using +, -, or ctrl-Home to position by line numbers, you can now supply a line number of up to 8 digits. Previously, only 6 digits were accepted.
  - The problem of positioning to a line after the end of file has been fixed.
