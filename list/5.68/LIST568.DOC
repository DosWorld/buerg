 Command  LIST
 -------------

 Purpose:  To display the contents of an ASCII text file,  line by  line
           with the aid of scrolling and positioning commands.

 Format:   LIST  [d:][path]filename[.ext]

 Remarks:  An ASCII file of any size may be listed.

           The "filename" is optional.  If omitted, you are prompted  to
        to enter  a filename.   You may  include drive,  path, and  wild
        cards in the file name.   The first file which matches  the name
        is displayed until an end-of-file character is encountered. Each
        file which matches the "filename" may be displayed.

           LIST was  designed to  display ASCII  files.  That  is, files
        which  contain  text  and  not  binary  or  control codes.  Text
        characters usually range from a value of 32 to 127.

           Characters  below  32  (a  blank)  are  replaced with a funny
        character to indicate that a non-displayable character has  been
        encountered.  This character is an upside-down question mark.

           Characters above 127 may be valid graphic characters, and may
        be displayed if  the '8' command  is in effect.   To insure that
        characters above ASCII value 127 are not displayed, use the  '7'
        command.

           The top line of the display gives the file name, current right
        scroll offset, and the file's creation date and time. Optionally,
        a ruler may be displayed on the top line by using the alt-R keys.

           The  file  is  displayed  with  one  logical  record  on each
        80-column display line.   A logical record  ends in a  linefeed.
        The maximum logical record may  be 255 characters long.  If  the
        record exceeds 80  characters, you may  view the portion  beyond
        the 80 columns  by using the  scroll right command,  or by using
        the Wrap feature.

           The Wrap  command toggles  ON or  OFF the  wrapping of  lines
        longer than 80 characters.  With Wrap on, lines are displayed in
        their  entirety,  80  characters  per  display line.  The scroll
        -left and -right functions are disabled when Wrap is ON.

           The file may  be PRINTed as  it it displayed.   The P command
        toggles  the  printer  on  or  off.   When  first entered, the P
        command causes the current screen  to be printed.  As new  lines
        are displayed, they too are printed.  Printing may be stopped by
        entering another P command.  The PrtSc key may also be used, but
        the title and prompt lines will be printed with the lines of the
|       file. Empty lines cause a line to be skipped on the printer. The
|       letter P is displayed in column 80 of the top line while printing.

 Key functions and Commands (cont.)
 --------------------------


    Control key      Function
    -----------     -------------------------------------------
     alt-C           clone LIST.COM, change colors permanently in program file
     alt-R           toggles display of a ruler on the top line



 Cloning procedure
 -----------------

|          The screen colors, the display retrace testing (M), the file
|       closing (C) and ruler (alt-R) options may be permanently set in
|       the program by using the alt-C cloning function.

|          For cloning to take effect, the program must be called
|       LIST.COM and it must be on the current drive and in the current
|       directory.


 DEBUG Information
 -----------------

           An alternative to cloning is to use DEBUG to make permanent
        changes. Here is a list of key items and their addresses:

           0125 - special lines 1 and 25 colors, default is 01
                  Refer to a technical reference guide for the
                  attribute values for the colors that you want.
           0127 - normal lines 2 thru 24 colors, default is 02
           0129 - bright color for Find/Scan, default is 04
           012B - options; bits 6, 7 and 8
                   .... .SAR  S=shared, x'04'
                              A=ruler, x'02
                              R=retrace, x'01'
                  By specifying the bit value, the option is enabled.
                  For example, to enable Shared and Retrace, specify
                  a hex value of 05.

           The letters and command keys may also be changed.  There are
        two tables involved:  WHAT and WHERE.  The WHAT table contains a
        list of one-byte keyboard codes.  The WHERE table contains a
        list of two-byte addresses.  If you really want to change the
        codes, here are the DEBUG addresses:

           034F - *WHAT* eye catcher
           0355 - list of one byte command letters and codes

           0387 - *WHERE* eye catcher
           038E - list of two byte addresses of processing routines


        NOTE: These DEBUG addresses are version dependent.

 Screen attributes
 -----------------

           The colors used for displaying the titles and main body of
        text may be changed temporarily or permanently.  To make a
        permanent change, the cloning command alt-C is used.  It
        requires that the LIST.COM program file be on the current drive
        and in the current directory.

           There are three classes of attributes used.  One for normal
        display lines - lines 2 to 24 - another for special lines -
        lines 1 and 25, and a third for the Find/Scan color.  The border
        is not changed.  The foreground color applies to the characters
        displayed.

        These color attributes may be changed by using these function keys:

          For the main body of text:

            F5 - background color
            F6 - foreground color

          For the top and bottom lines:

            F7 - background color
            F8 - foreground color


        Once you have decided upon the colors, use the alt-C key
        combination to change the LIST.COM program file.

                                                        LIST     Page 6

 Scanning for text
 -----------------


           You may use  Find (\)  to search for text  regardless  of the
        case, or you may use Scan (/) to find an exact match.

           To scan for a character string, type a slash (/) followed  by
|       one or more (up to 31)  characters.  The scan text, but not  the
        slash,  is  displayed  on  the  command  line.  The scan is case
        sensitive.  That is, lower case scan text will only match  lower
        lower case file text.

           While  the  program  is  searching  for  the text, the bottom
        display line is changed to say "Scanning".

           If the text is found, the line containing it is displayed  as
        a high-intensity line (bright color).

           If the text is NOT found, the bottom line (25) is changed  to
        say '*** text not found ***', and the display remains unchanged.
|       If the file exceeds 64k, it may be necessary to re-enter the
|       scan text each 64k byte segment. This is a known problem that
|       will be corrected in a future version.

           To find the next occurrance of the same text,  use the A)gain
        command, or press the F3 key.

|          In a shared file environment, if the file changes while being
|       listed, the file position may become invalid. Use the HOME command
|       to insure proper file synchronization, or use the C (shared) option.

 Restrictions
 ------------

           Some positioning is relative to the current block in storage.
        The size of the block depends on the amount of memory available,
        and up to 64K-bytes is allocated to the file buffer. The program
        requires at least 6K bytes.

        o  PC-DOS Version 2.0 or later is required.

        o  ANSI.SYS is NOT required.


        Written by Vernon Buerg for the  IBM PC using DOS 2.0 or
