FV - Verbose Archive Directory Lister                              Version 1.35
-------------------------------------                            March 12, 1991



Purpose:  To display the names and attributes of files contained within archive
          files with extensions of ARC, ZIP, PAK, DWC, LZH, ZOO, LBR, and most
          self-extracting .COM and .EXE files created by archive utilities.



Format:   FV  [d:][path]filespec[.ext] [filespecs ... filespecs]
                                       [/p] [/b] [/w] [/r] [/c] [/x]
                                       [>outfile]



Notes:    If no operands are entered, a display of the program's command format
          is displayed.

          The drive and path are optional. The filespec may contain the
          wildcard characters * and ?.  All archive files matching the file
          specification are processed.

          If the filespec extension is omitted, all known archive extensions
          are checked.

          The 'filespecs' operand limits the display to filenames within the
          archives which match this file specification. There may be up to
          eight 'filespecs'.

          Use the /p parameter to pause the display when the screen fills.

          Use the /b parameter to suppress the d:\path information in the
          display.

          Use the /w parameter to display member names only in a 5-up display.

          Use the /c parameter to display archive and file comments for ZIP
          files.

          The /r redate option changes the archive file date to be the latest
          date of the files within the archive.

          The /x option converts a self-extracting (.EXE) file to a new archive
          file with the proper extension and format in the current directory.
