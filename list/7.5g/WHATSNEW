LIST Version 7.5g               WHAT'S NEW                              3/11/91

                           New Command Line Switches
                           -------------------------

|     - a new /? command line switch display LIST usage information

      - a new /E command line switch tells LIST to begin displaying the files
        at the end of each file instead of at the beginning.

      - A new /Ttext command line parameter searches all files immediately
        for the 'text' and is case sensitive.  The /Ftext or /Ttext parameter
        must be the last on the command line.  Both cannot be used at one time.

      - The /Ftext command line parameter to begin a text search through all
        selected files now invokes the Find function which is NOT case
        sensitive.

      - A new /B command line switch tells LIST to use BIOS for displaying data

|     - A new /D command line switch to force display of the File Selection
|       menu for the specified files, e.g. *.TXT for only .TXT files

      - A new /K command line switch disables the mouse.  Both the /M and /K
        mouse options are clonable.

|     - A new /Q command line option (and alt-Q command) to toggle sounding
|       of beeps and bells.

|     - A new /V command line switch which causes a verify function to be
|       performed after any Copy or Move function

      - A new /#nnnnnn command line switch instructs LIST to begin displaying
        the file starting at line number 'nnnnnn'.

|     - A new /4 command line switch may be used to place LIST into 43/50
|       display mode; this requires an EGA or VGA display adapter.

|     - The /L, /W, and /J command line switches now allow for disabling the
|       function (in case LIST was cloned with the option on). To do this, add
|       a minus sign, e.g. /W- will set wrap off.  The B, D, and Q switches
|       are toggles. That is, specifying them reverses the default (or
|       cloned setting .

                        New Operational Features
                        ------------------------

      - the distribution files are LISTS.COM (small), LISTR.COM (regular), and
        LIST.COM (plus)

      - The new LIST environment variable tells LIST where to place temporary
        files for the ViewArc and archive extraction functions, e.g.

                SET LIST=C:\TEMP

|    -  All DEBUG offsets and information have been replaced by a new
|       program called LISTOPT which is used to set defaults and options.
|       LISTOPT is available to registered and licensed users only.
LIST Version 7.5g                 WHAT'S NEW                            3/11/91

      - The maximum "logical" record size has been increased from 910 to 2048.

      - A second Help screen is now available in the Plus version which shows
        all of the Ctrl- and cursor key functions

      - A great improvement in speed is available when all filter options are
        set off.  Use alt-Z to display the toggles on the bottom line.  An
        option is off when its corresponding letter, e.g.  'J' for alt-J junk
        filter or 'T' for the alt-T tab expansion filter, is in lower case.

|     - The Viewarc function now assumes that .EXE and .COM files are self-
|       extracting files and will actually execute them to extract the
|       selected file. Not all self-extracting programs support this.
|       Otherwise, if a file does not have the .ARC, .LZH, .ZIP, .PAK,
|       or .SDN extension, the file is assumed to be a .ARC file.

|     - The top status line while viewing a file has changed. Until the last
|       record number is known, LIST now displays a percentage of the file
|       read so far.


                              File Selection Menu
                              -------------------

      - New commands are available from the File Selection (Alt-V) menu:

              E    invokes the 'Edit' editor to let you edit the selected file;
                   create a BATch file called EDIT.BAT which invokes the
                   editor of your choice with the optional parameters it needs

              I    invokes (executes) the selected program

          Alt-Z    toggles the status display on the bottom line from disk and
                   file statistics line to a menu command help line

      - Changes to other file selection menu (Alt-V) commands:

         -  Q)uit returns you to the display of the last file you viewed
            if no file has been displayed, Q exits to DOS.

         -  X and F10 exit to DOS in the NEW directory

         -  ESCape exits to DOS in the ORIGINAL directory

         -  Alt-X exits to DOS and shows the original screen

         -  the 1-up display now includes the file attributes

         -  Alt-C saves (clones) the settings

         -  the S)ort command now has a None (no sort) ordering option

|        -  a \ may be used in place of the P)ath command to change directories

|        -  you may press the shift key and a letter key to move the selection
|           to the first filename beginning with that letter, e.g. shift-C will
|           put the cursor on the first file name beginning with the letter 'c'
LIST Version 7.5g               WHAT'S NEW                              3/11/91

                                 New Commands
                                 ------------

      - A new ctrl-Y command saves the current position as a bookmark, and
        alt-Y repositions to the last bookmark. You may set up to 10 bookmarks.

      - A new 1 command restarts displaying files with the first file.

      - A new Ctrl-right command scrolls the screen right to the end of the
        current line.

      - A new O command toggles the date format from U.S. mm/dd/yy to
        European format dd-mm-yy.

                                Changed Commands
                                ----------------

      - The X command exits to DOS and clears the screen. In the Plus version,
        you are now placed in the new (selected) directory.

      - The Alt-G command (shell to DOS) now clears the screen.

      - The Alt-D and Alt-O (write lines to a file) commands have been changed
        to default to writing a found (highlighted line after Scan or Find)
        line if no lines have been marked.

|     - All commands which ask for a d:\path and/or a filename now check for
|       embedded blanks and non-valid characters.

      - The ctrl-I command has been added to the Plus version.  It allows
        setting the TAB interval to values other than the standard 8.  Ctrl-I
        prompts you to enter the new interval, which can be from 1 to 99.

|     - The ctrl-D dial command will initially place the cursor on a line
|       with found text, i.e. you scan for a name and LIST find it. The found
|       text is highlighted. When you issue ctrl-D, the cursor is placed there.
|       LIST copies all numbers and valid telephone number characters, like
|       dash and comma, up to the first non-numeric character as the phone
|       number. Also, if the telephone number has more than 7 digits, LIST will
|       prefix the number with a 1 unless the phone number starts with a 1.
