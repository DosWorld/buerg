LIST Version 7.2                                                       11/26/89

        The distribution files have changed. They are now:

        LIST.COM  - LIST Plus version with all of the commands
        LISTR.COM - regular version
        LISTS.COM - small version

        The default filter options are now:
          alt-T   - expand TABs is ON
          alt-J   - filter out control characters is ON

        A great improvement in speed is available when all filter
        options are set off.  Use alt-Z to display the toggles on the
        bottom line.  An option is off when its corresponding letter,
        e.g.  'J' for alt-J junk filter or 'T' for the alt-T tab
        expansion filter, is in lower case.

      Other changes:
      -------------

        The X command exits to DOS and clears the screen.  In the Plus
        version, you are now returned to the original directory.

        The ctrl-I command has been added to the Plus version.  It
        allows setting the TAB interval to values other than the
        standard 8.  Ctrl-I prompts you to enter the new interval, which
        can be from 1 to 128.

        The /Ftext command line parameter to begin a text search through
        all selected files now invokes the Find function which is not
        case sensitive.

        In the File Selection (alt-V) menu:
         - the ESCape and Quit commands no longer exit, they return to
           the display of the last file you viewed.
         - the 1-up display now includes file attributes.

        New file selection commands have been added:
         -  Alt-C to clone settings
         -  Alt-X to exit to DOS and show the original screen
         -  Q now returns to viewing the last file
         -  X exits to DOS in the original directory
         -  F10 exits to DOS

        Command line switches are now supported in all versions.

        The /M mouse command line option is now clonable.

        The Viewarc function now assumes that .EXE and .COM files are
        LHARC files.  Otherwise, if a file does not have the .ARC, .LZH,
        or .ZIP extension, the file is assumed to be a .ARC file.

        The Help (F1) screen now only occupies the current window.

        The F2/F4 keys for setting the color of the found line now
        operate on the Find line, i.e.  the line where found text is
        displayed.  The entire found line is now highlighted, and the
        found text is shown in reversed video.

        The following offsets change from version to version. Look for the
        eye-catchers to be sure of the offset:

        Key table       0368    'WHAT'  Eye catcher
                        036C    0026    Key command table
        Routines        048E    'WHERE' Eye catcher
                        0493    xxxx    Command routines

        Examples of using DEBUG can be found in the DIALER.PAT and
        COLORS.PAT files. To use them, copy LIST.COM to the current
        directory and issue the DEBUG command. For example:

                DEBUG <DIALER.PAT
