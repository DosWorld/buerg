                        displayed

        alt-V           displays names of files in the current directory; you
                        can then select one for viewing, deleting, etc.

                        To select a file, use the arrow key, or tab, shift-tab,
                        home, and end keys to place the cursor at a file name.
                        Press the letter of the function you want.

                        Subdirectories are shown with an up or down arrow
                        next to them. The up arrow entry move you to the
                        parent directory. The down arrow entries move you to

                        you be in the selected directory, not the original one.

                        The Delete function will remove an empty directory.
                        The ESCape ane Quit commands no longer exit, they
                        return to the display of the last file viewed.

        alt-Z           Toggles display on bottom line from "Keys:"
                        to "Toggles:"

        Expanded function:
        -----------------
        Find/Scan       wildcard character ? can be supplied as part of the
                        search text; the & character can be used an an escape
                        character to allow including ? as part of the search
                        text. Also, if the found text is off-screen, the
                        display is automatically scrolled left or right to
                        bring the found text into view. Only the search text
                        is highighted.

        alt-O           the write file name is remembered across files
        alt-D

        alt-W           the screen may be split horizontally and vertically
                        by moving the cursor to the desired screen position

                        You may scroll either of the two windows. Move between
                        the two windows with c-PgDn and c-PgUp.

                        Use of alt-V file selection is not recommended at this
                        with a vertical split.

                        Use of the Help function will destroy the first window.
                        It is best for now to get out of split screen, invoke
                        Help, and then split the screen again.

                        The second and subsequent windows are displayed in the
                        window-text color. You set that with the usual F-keys
                        when viewing in the second window. You can clone the
                        second color, but do so in full (not split) screen
                        mode.
