                        you want as a column for the middle boundary. Then,
                        press enter. It helps if you change the text colors

                        for A?B, while F A?B would look for A followed by any
                        character, followed by B.

                        Changes from 6.4a to 7.0a (cont.)

                        until the string BBS was found. You resume the scan

LIST Version 7.0                                                       10/15/89

                           Changes from 6.3a to 6.4a
                           -------------------------

 6.36, 9/03/88  - When scanning for text, the messages "text not found"
                  used to blink. That was changed to allow hi-itensity
                  colors in 63a. The blinking has been restored.

                - When invoking LIST without a filename, the "New file:"
                  prompt was invisible. That has been corrected.

                - Corrected exiting cursor after alt-E.

                - After toggling the 25/43(50) line mode with alt-E,
                  a VGA was displaying line 25 a couple of lines
                  above the bottom line. This has been fixed.

                - The continuous scroll rate was too fast for some
                  users. The default scroll rate is now the slowest
                  possible. To increase the rate, press the minus (-)
                  key twice to get the fastest rate, or press the plus
                  key (and hold it down) until you get the faster rate
                  that you want. You can then clone (alt-C) this rate
                  for future use.

                - When using P to print a screen, pressing any key
                  wasn't stopping the printer like 62a was. This has
                  been corrected.

                - Corrected the inability to accept one digit line numbers.

                - Changing or invoking a filter repositioned the display
                  to line 1. This was done because the number of lines in
                  the file may have changed and the position became
                  invalid. The 7, 8, *, and alt-T (tab) filters now
                  resume the display at the same line number. The alt-J
                  and Wrap filters still restart the display at line 1.

                - When using +, -, or ctrl-Home to position by line
                  numbers, you can now supply a line number of up
                  to 8 digits. Previously, only 6 digits were accepted.

                - The problem of positioning to a line after the end of
                  file has been fixed.

 6.37, 9/08/88  - Corrected alt-E setting an invalid video mode when
                  returning to 25-line mode.

                - Corrected alt-G failing with "Not enough memory".

 6.38, 9/14/88  - improved detection of EOF for up arrow.
 6.4a, 9/21/88  - correct PgDn skipping one line too many after up-arrow.
