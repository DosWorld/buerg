LIST.COM is a public domain program that will list a text file one page
at a time. Thus, no more <CTRL><S> and <CTRL><Q> as with the TYPE command!

Because there is an online help screen to explain the functions of LIST,
all you really need to know is how to start the program:

     LIST filename.ext [for the file you want to view]

If you forget to enter the filename and extension, you will be prompted
to enter these.
