Thank you for your interest in the Buerg Utilities. You are required to
license one copy of the software for each computer on which it is used; the
fee for a license depends on the total number of copies you will use at one
site. Licenses are for perpetual, non-exclusive use of the current or a
previous version of the program. Upgrades are free upon request, for 90
days to licensed users of LIST; a nominal shipping and handling fee will be
charged. Upgrade information will be available on our website at
http://www.buerg.com. Regardless of the quantity licensed, only one set of
materials will be furnished; additional manuals may be purchased at the
prices shown on the enclosed price list. Additional manuals will require
additional shipping charges. Customization of messages and documentation
may be done at a fee of $200 per hour, with a two-hour minimum charge (call
with requests).

To determine the license fee, apply the total number of computers to the
worksheet below.

For Local Area Networks, one copy must be licensed for each computer on the
network.

TERMS:  We accept VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.

We will also accept corporate and government purchase orders with prior
authorization.
