                               LICENSING FOR LIST
                               Effective  8/06/90

 LIST is  not a  public domain  program.  Copies  of LIST  for personal use are
 free, but if you find  LIST of value, you are  encouraged to make a gift  ($20
 suggested) and become a  LIST supporter.  You may  also register your copy  of
 LIST Plus for  $30 and receive  a disk and  manual along with  notification of
 future versions.  A license  is required for use  of LIST by corporations  and
 institutions, and for its commercial distribution.

 Technical support is  available to LIST  supporters and licensees  through the
 VOR bulletin board system at (707) 778-8944 and (415) 994-2944 at no charge.

 This information also applies to my ARChive, SORTF, QDR, FBR and to any of  my
 other programs that may be of interest to you.

 You may  obtain a  license for  the use  of LIST  by writing  or phoning.  The
 license  is  for  perpetual,  non-exclusive  use  of the current or a previous
 version.  Purchase orders and  invoicing are acceptable.  A  license agreement
 form is enclosed, but is not required  by me.  You may use it, or  supply your
 own for my review.  The FAX number is (707) 778-8728.

 If you have special requirements, such as licensing for an unlimited number of
 copies, or customization, please feel free to submit them in writing.  You may
 request a license for:

          o  a fixed number of copies, see the discount schedule;
          o  an unlimited number of copies;
          o  customization of messages and documentation,  an additional
             fee may be required depending on the extent of changes;
          o  permission  to  include  with  your  company's   commercial
             products (see the  commercial  distribution schedule);
          o  licensing for multiple sites;
          o  or other needs.

 The fee for a license depends on the estimated number of copies of the program
 that you will use.  The fee applies to one site.  For local area networks, one
 copy must be licensed for each computer that will be using the program on  the
 network.  To  use the  discount schedule  below, estimate  the total number of
 copies that you may eventually use.
