NOTES on LISTOS2 conversion; version 75h

  -   Requires OS/2 version 1.2 or above to run.

  -   Long filenames are not supported.

  -   F10 in ALT-V File management function only exits to 
      original directory.

  -   The /S parameter is not necessary under OS/2.  For example you
      can just type PSTAT | LIST

  -   The ^F send formfeed command has been commented out because the
      spooler also inserts formfeeds.

  -   Mouse support is not active in a PM windowed session.

  -   When mouse support is active in LIST, "Shelling" to other full 
      screen applications that use the mouse may require that 
      you CTRL-BREAK out of the second application.

  -   Patching: offsets are different, relative offsets are same.
        - COM device name has been moved next to "WHAT" eyecatcher.
        - Cloneable area starts at about 4A16 Hex bytes into file.

  -   Clone: You need to type in the new clone filename, as you
      cannot overwrite an executing file under OS/2.

  -   FV:  An equivalent OS/2 archive file viewer is not available.
      However, if you only use ZIP files, put the following FV.CMD
      in your path:

PKUNZIP -v %1
