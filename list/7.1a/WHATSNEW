LIST Version 7.1                                                       10/28/89

        The distribution files have changed. They are now:

        LIST.COM  - LIST Plus version with all features
        LISTR.COM - regular version
        LISTS.COM - small version

        The default filter options are now:

        alt-T   - expand TABs
        alt-J   - filter out control characters

        A great improvement in speed is available when all filter
        options are set off.  Use alt-Z to display the toggles on
        the bottom line.  An option is off when its corresponding
        letter, e.g. J for alt-J junk filter, is in lower case.


        Corrections to version 7.0:
        --------------------------

|       7.15, 10/26/89 - correct new filter EOF problem
|                      - correct Q from a-v menu when no files have been viewed
|       7.14, 10/25/89 - improve speed if no options (alt-J,*,alt-H,etc) set,
|                        and change filter defaults; this is a new
|                        FAST FILTER option. It is skips all checks for control
|                        characters. You will see control characters, such as
|                        line feeds, displayed. The trade off is speed. Loading
|                        and scanning is up to 4 times faster with the fast
|                        filter setting.
|       7.13, 10/23/89 - change Ctrl-I to be TAB interval command
|                      - change Q in a-v to return to viewing of last file
|                      - add Alt-X in a-v as exit with original screen
|                      - correct c-end in a-v
|                      - change F2/F4 to change found line attributes; the
|                        last line is used to show the new colors if found
|                        text is not displayed on the current screen

|                      - add LZH to ViewArc/a-i

|                        with 5 up or less. 6-up truncates the last character
|                        of full length subdirectory names
|                      - change default a-v display to 5-up
|                      - correct a-v sort by date/time
|       7.11, 10/20/89 - allow d:\path command line syntax
|                      - change a-v down arrow to wrap to first entry after
|                        positioning to last entry (wraps around)

|                        in the manual
|                      - correct cloning of second window color
|                      - add ctrl-J to redefine TAB interval

                        displayed

        alt-V   **      displays names of files in the current directory; you

        Expanded function:
        -----------------
        Find/Scan       wildcard character ? can be supplied as part of the
                        search text; the & character can be used an an escape
                        character to allow including ? as part of the search
                        text. Also, if the found text is off-screen, the
                        display is automatically scrolled left or right to
                        bring the found text into view. Only the search text
                        is highighted. The fastest scan is for case sensitive
                        text without wildcards.

        alt-O           the write file name is remembered across files
        alt-D

        alt-W           the screen may be split horizontally and vertically
                        by moving the cursor to the desired screen position

                        You may scroll either of the two windows. Move between
                        the two windows with c-PgDn and c-PgUp.

                        Use of alt-V file selection is not recommended at this
                        with a vertical split.

                        Use of the Help function will destroy the first window.
                        It is best for now to get out of split screen, invoke
                        Help, and then split the screen again.

                        The second and subsequent windows are displayed in the
                        window-text color. You set that with the usual F-keys
                        when viewing in the second window. You can clone the
                        second color, but do so in full (not split) screen
                        mode.
