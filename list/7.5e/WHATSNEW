LIST Version 7.5e               WHAT'S NEW                              9/27/90

                        New Operational Features
                        ------------------------

      - the distribution files are LISTS.COM (small), LISTR.COM (regular), and
        LIST.COM (plus)

      - The new LIST environment variable tells LIST where to place temporary
        files for the ViewArc and archive extraction functions, e.g.

                SET LIST=C:\TEMP

|     - A new /E command line switch tells LIST to begin displaying the files
|       at the end of each file instead of at the beginning.

      - A new /K command line switch disables the mouse.  Both the /M and /K
        mouse options are clonable.

      - A new /#nnnnnn command line switch instructs LIST to begin displaying
        the file starting at line number 'nnnnnn'.

      - The /Ftext command line parameter to begin a text search through all
        selected files now invokes the Find function which is NOT case
        sensitive.

      - The maximum "logical" record size has been increased from 910 to 2048.

      - A second Help screen is now available in the Plus version which shows
        all of the Ctrl- and cursor key functions

      - A great improvement in speed is available when all filter options are
        set off.  Use alt-Z to display the toggles on the bottom line.  An
        option is off when its corresponding letter, e.g.  'J' for alt-J junk
        filter or 'T' for the alt-T tab expansion filter, is in lower case.

      - The Viewarc function now assumes that .EXE and .COM files are LHARC
        files.  Otherwise, if a file does not have the .ARC, .LZH, or .ZIP
        extension, the file is assumed to be a .ARC file.


                              File Selection Menu
                              -------------------

      - New commands are available from the File Selection (Alt-V) menu:

              E    invokes the 'Edit' editor to let you edit the selected file;
                   create a BATch file called EDIT.BAT which invokes the
                   editor of your choice with the optional parameters it needs


              I    invokes (executes) the selected program


          Alt-Z    toggles the status display on the bottom line from disk and
                   file statistics line to a menu command help line

LIST Version 7.5e                 WHAT'S NEW                            9/25/90


      - Changes to other file selection menu (Alt-V) commands:

         -  Q)uit returns you to the display of the last file you viewed
            if no file has been displayed, Q exits to DOS.

         -  X and F10 exit to DOS in the NEW directory

         -  ESCape exits to DOS in the ORIGINAL directory

         -  Alt-X exits to DOS and shows the original screen


         -  the 1-up display now includes the file attributes

         -  Alt-C saves (clones) the settings

         -  the S)ort command now has a None (no sort) ordering option


                                 New Commands
                                 ------------

      - A new ctrl-Y command saves the current position as a bookmark, and
        alt-Y repositions to the last bookmark. You may set up to ten bookmarks
        and recall them in the same order.

      - A new 1 command restarts displaying files with the first file.

      - A new Ctrl-right command scrolls the screen right to the end of the
        current line.


                                Changed Commands
                                ----------------

      - The X command exits to DOS and clears the screen. In the Plus version,
        you are now placed in the new (selected) directory.

      - The Alt-G command (shell to DOS) now clears the screen.

      - The Alt-R Ruler option has been improved to better show offsets
        when in the Hex Dump (Alt-H) display mode.

      - The Alt-D and Alt-O (write lines to a file) commands have been changed
        to default to writing a found (highlighted line after Scan or Find)
        line if no lines have been marked.

      - The ctrl-I command has been added to the Plus version.  It allows
        setting the TAB interval to values other than the standard 8.  Ctrl-I
        prompts you to enter the new interval, which can be from 1 to 99.

        Examples of using DEBUG can be found in the DIALER.PAT and
        COLORS.PAT files. To use them, copy LIST.COM to the current
        directory and issue the DEBUG command. For example:

                DEBUG <DIALER.PAT
