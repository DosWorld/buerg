                        F10             Exit

 Restrictions:
        All positioning is relative to the current block in
        storage. The size of the block depends on the amount of
        memory available, up to 64K.

        The maximum record length currently allowed is 255.

        Logical records (ending in LF and/or CR) are placed
        into the DOS screen buffer - mono or color display.

        PC-DOS Version 2.0 or later is required.

        ANSI.SYS is NOT required.

 Scanning for text:
        To scan for a character string, type a slash (/)
        followed by one or more (up to 32) characters. The
        scan text, but not the slash, is displayed on the
        command line. Only the current block is scanned.

        If the text is found, the line containing it is displayed
        as a blinking line.

        If the text is NOT found, an error message is displayed
        and the display remains unchanged. To scan the next block,
        "page" into it with PgDn or Down, and use F3 to re-scan.

 Screen attributes:
        There are three classes of attributes used. One for
        normal display lines - lines 2 to 24, another for
        special lines - lines 1 and 25, and a third for the
        background color.

        These attributes may be changed by using DEBUG:

         at offset 11C = 09     ;special lines, hi-lighted or lt.blue
         at offset 11D = 02     ;normal lines, green
         at offset 11E = 07     ;background, black - foreground, white

        If these values don't match, you have a different version.

SVSC Librarian comment:  This version strips the high bit from all
  characters.  This provides a normal display of a WordStar file.  If
  you desire to see extended ASCII characters in their true representation
  then either:
        Use DEBUG to NOP the bit mask with:   -E8d1 90 90
  or
        Comment out the And AL,07h after the GetR4 label in the source.


  If you desire to show control characters such as form feeds then either:

       Use DEBUG to make the JAE a JMP with: -E7fc EB
  or

       Comment out the CMP, JAE, ADD & JMP instructions following the
       Dsp2: label.
