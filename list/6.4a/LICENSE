                               LICENSING FOR LIST
                               Effective 7/25/88

    Copies of LIST for personal use are free.  If you find LIST of
    value, you are encouraged to make a gift ($15 suggested) and become
    a LIST supporter.  A license is required for use of LIST by
    corporations and institutions, and for its commercial distribution.

    This information also applies to my SORTF, QDR, FBR programs, and to
    any of my other programs that may be of interest to you.

    Licensing for ARCE and other ARC utilities is available from System
    Enhancement Associates, 21 New Street, Wayne, NJ 07470; phone (201)
    473-5153.

    You may obtain a license for the use of LIST by writing to me.  The
    license is for perpetual, non-exclusive use of any version.  Purchase
    orders and invoicing are acceptable.  A license agreement form is
    enclosed.  You may use it, or supply your own for my review.  There are
    no restrictions to the number of sites, or for use on local area
    networks.  If you have special requirements, such as licensing for an
    unlimited number of copies, or customization, please feel free to submit
    them in writing.  You may request a license for:

          o  a fixed number of copies, see the discount schedule;
          o  an unlimited number of copies, the fee is $1250;
          o  LIST source code for internal use, a minimum fee of $750 in
             addition to other fees;
          o  customization of messages and documentation,  an additional
             fee may be required depending on the extent of changes;
          o  permission to distribute within your organization;
          o  permission  to  include  with  your  company's   commercial
             products; see the  commercial  distribution schedule
          o  or other needs.

    The fee for a license depends on the estimated number of copies of the
    program that you will use.  If you wish to distribute LIST with your own
    programs, and you do not know the exact number that you need, you may
    license the program for an unlimited number.  To use the discount
    schedule below, estimate the total number of copies that you may
    eventually use.

                 1   to 9                 $ 15.00

Thank you for the interest you have shown in distributing my programs.
While I distribute my software freely to individuals, I do not adhere to
the concept of distribution on a commercial basis, such as you have
proposed, since the programs will be sold, rather than given freely.
However, since this practice is becoming more prevalent, I have decided to
make my programs available according to the commercial distribution license
fee schedule below.

                      Licensing is available for:

               o  File Backup and Restore ......... FBR

               o  File viewing utility ............ LIST
               o  Laserjet Booklet Printer ........ LJBOOK
               o  Quick Basic Cross Referencer .... QBX
               o  File Sort Utility ............... SORTF
               o  Quick Diskette Reformatter ...... QDR

- Commercial distribution license fee is $50 per program plus the per-copy
  cost shown in the schedule below.
- Source is available for internal use only at a cost of $750 per program;
  this is in addition to other license fees.
- Buerg Software will supply one disk and one manual under this licensing
  agreement.  Additional manuals are available at a cost of $3 per manual.
- Fee schedules shown are for the programs with and without the solicitation
  included.
  * If licensed without the solicitation, changes will be made to include
    "LICENSED TO your company name".
  * If licensed with the solicitation, no changes may be made to the
    program, other than those agreed to by Buerg Software at the time of
    licensing.

                                                    COST PER COPY
