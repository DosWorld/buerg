Description of Use 
______________________________________________________________________________


    Introduction 
 
            You use LIST to display files on your monitor, line by  line 
        with the aid of scrolling, positioning and filtering commands. 
 

    Command line format 
 
        The command line format is: 
 
 
        LIST [filespec...filespec] [/S][/J][/7][/8][/*][/W][/H][/L] 
 
 
        where filespec is one or more names of files and the optional  / 
        switches are: 
 
                /S       indicates viewing a piped or redirected file 
                /J       sets Junk filter on 
                /7       sets 7-bit display 
                /8       sets 8-bit display 
                /*       sets star filter on 
                /W       sets Wrap on 
                /H       sets Hex dump mode 
                /L       sets pre-Loading on 
 
            The command line switch character is normally a slash,  "/", 
        but LIST  will use  whatever character  that is  defined to  DOS 
        as the command line switch character, e.g. a dash, "-". 
 

    Installation 
 
            There are two .COM files and this .DOC file on the disk that 
        you received (or  in the .ARC  file that you  downloaded).  Copy 
        the two .COM files to your working disk, and into the  directory 
        that is most convenient.  The LIST.COM file is the full featured 
        program, and  the LISTS.COM  file is  the small  version.  LISTS 
        runs in much less memory (about 29K) but is limited to files  of 
        about 50 thousand lines, or about 600 K bytes.  It also excludes 
        the  screen  saving  feature  (see  Alt-X), and the shell to DOS 
        command (see Alt-G), and the help screen. 
 
            You may rename the program file to any convenient name, such 
        as L.COM, READ.COM, or LIST.COM. 
 
        To print the documentation, set  your printer for six lines  per 
        inch,  and  10  characters  per  inch.   Then, use the DOS PRINT 
        command.  For example, 
 
                        PRINT LIST.DOC 
 
        The documentation file is marked  with | before new and  changed 
        lines. 
 





LIST  User's Guide                                                    Page  1 
How to use LIST 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            Using LIST is fairly straightforward.  You type the  command 
        LIST, at the  DOS prompt, followed  by the name(s)  of the files 
        that  you  want  to  see.   For  example:  LIST CONFIG.SYS would 
        display the file CONFIG.SYS. 
 
            Once the file is displayed  on your screen, you may  use the 
        cursor positioning keys to  move around and see  different parts 
        of the file.  For example,  when LIST first starts, you  see the 
        first 23 lines of the file.  To see the next 23 lines, or  page, 
        press the PgDn key.   The PgUp key moves  you back one page  and 
        shows you the  previous 23 lines.   The up-arrow and  down-arrow 
        keys move it one line at  a time.  When you are finished,  press 
        the ESCape key and you are returned to the DOS prompt. 
 
            The "filename" is optional.  If omitted, you are prompted to 
        enter a filename.  You may  include drive, path, and wild  cards 
        in the  file name.   The first  file which  matches that name is 
        displayed.  After  the file  is displayed,  the next  file which 
        matches the "filename" may be displayed, too. 
 
            You may also use LIST to display piped or redirected  files. 
        If you are unfamiliar with these, you may skip to the next page. 
 
            To display  a redirected  file, use  a <  (less than symbol) 
        before the name of the file  that was redirected and add the  /S 
        parameter to the LIST command.   For example, the output of  the 
        DIR command can be written to  a file called XYZ, and then  LIST 
        can be instructed to read that file. 
 
                dir a: >xyz 
                list <xyz /s 
 
            To display a piped file,  omit the filename, but supply  the 
        /S. 
 
                dir a: | list /s 
 
        Or, to LIST a file within an ARC archive: 
 
                arc /p arcname.arc filename.ext | list /s 
                                - or - 
                arce arcname filename.ext /p | list /S 
 
 
            Because files  contain different  kinds of  data, there  are 
        several commands  to tell  LIST how  to display  the data.   The 
        process that LIST uses to make the file data readable is  called 
        filtering.  The filters in LIST can: 
 
            o  replace non-text and control characters with blanks 
            o  expand TAB characters 
            o  display line drawing characters 
            o  change 8-bit (W*) data to readable 7-bit text 
            o  display the hexidecimal values for each character 
            o  remove "junk", such as control codes and backspaces 
 
            LIST was designed  to display ASCII  files.  That is,  files 
        which  contain  text,  and  not  binary  or control codes.  Text 
        characters usually  range from  a value  of 32  to 127.  To view

How to use LIST 
______________________________________________________________________________

        binary  files  (COM,  EXE,  etc),  the  alt-H (hex dump display) 
        command is available. 
 
 
            Characters  below  32  (a  blank)  are replaced with a funny 
        character to indicate that a non-displayable character has  been 
        encountered.  This  character is  an upside-down  question mark. 
        Characters above 127 may be valid graphic characters, and may be 
        displayed  if  the  '8'  command  is  in effect.  To insure that 
        characters above ASCII value 127 are not displayed, use the  '7' 
        command. 
 
 
            The top  line of  the display  gives the  file name, current 
        right  scroll  offset,  and  the  FILE's creation date and time. 
        Optionally, a ruler  may be displayed  on the top  line by using 
        the alt-R keys. 
 
            The  file  is  displayed  with  one  logical  record on each 
        display line: usually 80 characters.  A logical record ends in a 
        linefeed and  may be  up to  910 characters  long.  If  a record 
        exceeds 80 characters,  you may view  the portion beyond  the 80 
        columns by using the scroll right command, or by using the  Wrap 
        feature.  The Wrap (W) command toggles ON or OFF the wrapping of 
        lines  longer  than  80  characters.   With  Wrap  on, lines are 
        displayed in  their entirety,  80 characters  per display  line. 
        The scroll left (arrow) and right (arrow) functions are disabled 
        when Wrap is ON. 
 
            The file may be PRINTed  as it it displayed.  The  P command 
        toggles  the  printer  on  or  off.   When  first entered, the P 
        command causes the current screen  to be printed.  As new  lines 
        are displayed, they too are printed.  Printing may be stopped by 
        entering another P command.  The PrtSc key may also be used, but 
        the title and prompt lines will be printed with the lines of the 
        file.  Empty lines  cause a line  to be skipped  on the printer. 
        The  letter  P  is  displayed  on  the bottom command line while 
        printing.   See  the  section  on  extracting  lines  for  other 
        methods.

    Alt- keys 
 
        The Alt- key commands are entered by pressing the Alt key at the 
        same time as you press one of the following letter keys: 
 
 
    alt- letter      Function 
    -----------      --------------------------------------------------- 
 
     alt-A           toggle on if you are using APXCOREA; off (default) 
                     if using DesqView or DoubleDos 
 
     alt-B           mark bottom line 
 
     alt-C           clone LIST.COM, change colors or options permanently, 
                     in a new copy of the LIST.COM program file 
 
     alt-D           toggle dump mode: if no lines are marked, the current 
                     screen only is written to the specified file; if lines 
                     are marked, they are written to the dump file. 
 
     alt-E           toggle 25/43 line display (does test for EGA). If the 
                     actual EGA lines is not 25 or 43, don't use alt-E 
 
     alt-F           prompt for new Filespec or filename to display 
                     entering a leading asterisk (*) may be obscured 
                     by some console enhancers or utilities, so enter 
                     two asterisks, e.g. **.doc 
     alt-G           Shell to DOS, invoke COMMAND.COM, requires 96k or more. 
                     Use the DOS EXIT command to return to LIST. 
 
     alt-H           toggles hex dump formatted display 
 
     alt-J           toggle adding line feed to lone carriage returns 
                     and remove backspaces, overlaying previous characters 
 
     alt-L           toggles preloading of files; default is OFF 
                     When the file is pre-loaded, the number of the 
                     last line number becomes known. 
 
     alt-M           mark top line; marked lines may be printed or written 
                     to the alt-D dump file. 
 
     alt-N           toggles screen saving feature; with screen saving

     alt-W           toggles split screen; when ON, the top half of 
                     the screen is frozen. Further scrolling occurs 
                     only in the bottom half of the screen (window) 
                     until the alt-W keys are used again. 
 
     alt-Y           repositions the file to the last "active" line; 
                     that is a line positioned to by Find/Scan, or 
                     by alt-M/alt-B marking of lines. 
 
     alt-X           exits to DOS and displays the original screen

Scrolling 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            You view different parts of the file by scrolling.  That is, 
        you use the cursor positioning keys up, down, left and right  to 
        move the display one increment in that direction.  For  example, 
        press the down  arrow key to  move the display  one line in  the 
        file, i.e. display the next line in the file. 
 
            The  PgDn  and  PgUp  cursor  keys  move the display on full 
        screen in either direction. 
 
 
            Rather than press the up  and down keys once for  each line, 
        you  may  use  continuous  scrolling.   Use  the C key to toggle 
        continuous  scrolling  on  or  off.   The  default is off.  When 
        toggled on,  pressing the  up or  down arrow  keys results  in a 
        moving display.  For example, when you press the down arrow, the 
        next  line  of  the  file  is  displayed automatically every few 
        moments.  It is  like holding down  the arrow key.   To stop the 
        continuous scroll, press the space bar. 
 
 
            The  speed  of  the  continuous  scroll  can  be adjusted by 
        pressing the  + (plus)  or -  (minus) key  while the  display is 
        moving.  The  plus key  makes the  display move  faster, and the 
        minus key makes it move slower.  You can save the speed value by 
        using the cloning command (see Alt-C). 
 
 
        Summary of scrolling commands: 
 
            right arrow - move display right 10 columns 
            left arrow  - move display left 10 columns 
            down arrow  - display next line of file 
            up arrow    - display previous line of file 
            PgUp key    - display previous "page", 23 (or 41) lines back 
            PgDn key    - display next "page", 23 (or 41) lines ahead 
 
            C key       - turns continuous scrolling on or off 
            spacebar    - or any key, interrupts continuous scrolling 
            + (plus)    - makes continuous scroll incrementally faster 
            - (minus)   - makes continuous scroll slower

Positioning to Lines 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            Each displayable line of the file is assigned a line number. 
        The first line is assigned line number 1.  The highest allowable 
        line  number is 16 million.  In order to determine the last line 
        number, the  entire file  must be  read.  For  this reason,  the 
        first time that the END (bottom) command is issued, it will take 
        longer to process.  This is  not necessary if the file  has been 
        completely read (see the alt-L preloading option). 
 
            If the Wrap  option is in  effect, there is  one line number 
        required for  each 80  bytes of  the file's  records.  Thus, the 
        line number does not represent the actual number of lines in the 
        file. 
 
            If  the  hex  dump  option  is  in effect, there is one line 
        number required for each 16 bytes of the file.  For example,  an 
        80-byte file will be displayed as 5 lines. 
 
            You may  position to  a specific  line number  by using  the 
        c-Home, Ctrl key  and Home key,  or the #  key.  When c-Home  is 
        entered, you are prompted for the line number.  Enter the 1 to 5 
        digit line number.   The display will  now begin with  that line 
        number at the top of the screen. 
 
            To position forward or backward,  you may use the +  (plus), 
        or -  (minus) keys.   You are  prompted to  enter the  number of 
        lines to  be skipped.   The display  resumes at  the line number 
        shown on  the top  (status) line,  plus or  minus the  number of 
        lines that you specified. 
 
            When you  change a  filter option,  such as  Wrap, the  line 
        numbering changes.  An attempt is  made to retain the same  file 
        position, but the file may be repositioned at the top. 
 
 
        Summary of positioning commands: 
 
        ctrl-HOME, or #  - prompts for exact line number to display 
        + (plus)         - prompts for the number of lines to skip 
                           for positioning further ahead in the file 
        - (minus)        - prompts for the number of lines to skip 
                           for positioning to an earlier line

Displaying multiple files 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            You can display more than one file by supplying wildcards in 
        the file name.  For example,  LIST *.DOC will display all  files 
        with an extension of DOC. 
 
            To  display  the  next  file,  you  use  the  Q or ctrl-PgDn 
        command.  When the  last file has  been displayed, you  can exit 
        LIST by using the X,  F10, ESCape, or alt-X commands,  depending 
        on how you want the screen to look when LIST ends. 
 
            To display the previous file, you use the ctrl-PgUp (control 
        and PgUp keys together).  LIST can keep track of up to 20  files 
        at one time.  The line number for each file is also remembered. 
 
            Another way to LIST more than  one file is to use the  alt-F 
        command.  Alt-F asks you for a new file name, and you may  enter 
        a simple file name, or one that includes wild cards.  These  new 
        file names are added to the table of filenames that LIST  keeps. 
        Thus, you can use alt-F for several different filenames, and use 
        the ctrl-PgDn and ctrl-PgUp commands to move among them. 
 
 
        Summary of file review commands: 
 
        ctrl-PgUp       - display previous file 
        ctrl-PgDn       - display next file 
 
        alt-F           - prompt for new filename or filespec to display 
 
        ESCape          - exit to DOS 
        Q               - display next file; if none, exit to DOS 
                          leaving the last page on the screen 
        X               - exit to DOS with a blank screen 
        F10             - exit to DOS with a blank screen 
        alt-X           - exit to DOS and display the screen that was 
                          present when LIST was invoked

Marking and Extracting Lines 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            There are two ways that lines can be extracted from a file: 
 
              o  with the P (print) command, and 
              o  with the alt-D (dump data) command. 
 
            The lines to  be extracted are  either the current  lines on 
        the screen,  or lines  that you  have marked  with the alt-M and 
        alt-B commands. 
 
            To mark lines, you use  either the alt-M or alt-B  commands. 
        The alt-M command  marks the top  line on the  screen, and alt-B 
        marks the bottom line on the screen.  You can use either or both 
        commands to mark the starting and ending lines (in the range  of 
        lines  to  be  extracted).   The  marked  lines are displayed in 
        reverse video. 
 
            After  you  have  marked  a  range  of  lines, you use the P 
        (print) command to print all  of the marked lines.  Or,  you can 
        use the  alt-D (dump  data) command  to write  those lines  to a 
        file.  The alt-D command asks you for a file name.  If the  file 
        does not  exist, a  new one  is created.   If the  file  already 
        exists, the extracted lines are added (appended) to the file. 
 
            For example, you would like  to have LIST filter out  all of 
        the junk in a file, and then write a new file.  To do this,  you 
        might enter the following sequence of commands: 
 
                list TESTDATA           ... display your TESTDATA file 
                alt-J                   ... filters out the junk 
                alt-M                   ... marks line 1 (top line) 
                END                     ... positions to end of file 
                alt-B                   ... marks the bottom line 
                                                     (last line) 
                alt-D                   ... dumps data to a file 
                TESTDATE.NEW            ... you enter the new file name 
                alt-X                   ... quit and return to DOS 
 
 
            Once you have marked a range of lines, use of alt-M or alt-B 
        does not reset the entire line range.  The first or last  marked 
        line may  change, but  both do  not change.   Using alt-M  again 
        expands or contracts the  range appropriately.  If the  new line 
        for alt-M/alt-B is before the  top mark, the top mark  is moved. 
        If the new  line is after  the bottom mark,  the bottom mark  is 
        changed.  If the new line is within the currently marked  range, 
        alt-M moves the top mark - contracts the range - and alt-B moves 
        the bottom mark. 
 
 
            Use  the  alt-U  command  to  unmark lines, especially after 
        alt-D (dump) to be sure.

Display Format 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            The  monitor  display  is  defined  in  terms  of  lines and 
        columns.  A typical monitor can  display 25 lines of 80  columns 
        each.  LIST attempts to use the number of lines and columns  for 
        the monitor mode in use.  For  example, if the monitor is in  40 
        column mode, LIST displays only 40 characters per line.  And, if 
        the monitor is set  for other than 25  lines, such as 35  or 43, 
        LIST uses that number of lines. 
 
            If you use  the alt-E command  to change EGA  modes, the EGA 
        palette,  cursor,  and  other  settings  are  set to DOS default 
        values.  LIST does not preserve fonts or palettes. 
 
            The top line of the display is called the Status line.   The 
        bottom line is called the Command line.  The remaining lines are 
        called the  primary display  window, and  are usually  lines two 
        through 24. 
 

   Status Line Format 
 
        The Status line has the following format: 
 
                LIST   lllll nnnnnnn +sss mm/dd/yy hh:mm  - filename 
 
        where, 
 
        'LIST'     is the name of this program 
 
        'lllllll'  is the line number of the first line in the 
                   display window (usually on line 2) 
 
        'nnnnnnn'  is the line number of the last record, if known 
 
        '+sss'     if displayed, this is the Scroll amount, in 
                   multiples of 10, corresponding to the number 
                   of columns that the display has been shifted 
                   to the right to view records longer than 80 
 
        'mm/dd/yy' is the file's creation date (not today's date) 
        'hh:mm'    is the file's creation time (not today's time) 
 
 
        Note:      The date and time  shown on the top line is  NOT  the 
               current date.  It is the date and time  that the file was 
               created.

Screen Colors 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            The screen's lines may be in any of three different colors: 
 
                o  the 'special' color for the top status line and the 
                   bottom command line 
                o  the 'normal' color for the file's text windows 
                o  the 'bright' color for lines with Find/Scan text, 
                   and for the upside-down question mark in 7-bit mode 
 
            There is  a pair  of function  keys assigned  to each color. 
        You use these function keys at any time to change the background 
        and  foreground  colors  temporarily,  or  use the alt-C cloning 
        command to make the  colors permanent.  Alt-C requires  that the 
        LIST.COM program file be on the current drive and in the current 
        directory unless you are using DOS version 3.3  or  later.  With 
        DOS 3.3, the program file may have  any name  and may  reside in 
        any subdirectory. 
 
           The border is not  changed.  The foreground color  applies to 
        the color of the characters. 
 
        The color attributes may be changed by using these function keys: 
 
          For the main body of text: 
 
                F5 - background color 
                F6 - foreground color 
 
          For the top and bottom lines: 
 
                F7 - background color 
                F8 - foreground color 
 
          For the line with Find/Scan text: 
 
                F2 - background color 
                F4 - foreground 
 
            Once you  have decided  upon the  colors, use  the alt-C key 
        combination to change the LIST.COM program file.

            You may use Find (\ or  F) to search for text regardless  of 
        the case, or you may use Scan  (/ or S) to find an exact  match. 
        The search begins  at the top  line displayed and  proceeds in a 
        forward direction until the end of file.  You may start a search 
        that goes backwards  rather than forwards  by using the  ` (left 
        quote) key  instead of  Find (\),  or by  using '  (right quote) 
        instead of Scan (/). 
 
            To scan for a character string, type a slash (/) followed by 
        one or more (up to 31)  characters.  The Scan text, but not  the 
        slash,  is  displayed  on  the  command  line.  The Scan is case 
        sensitive.  That is, lower case Scan text will only match  lower 
        case file text. 
 
            While  the  program  is  searching  for the text, the bottom 
        display line  is changed  to say  "Scanning".  Pressing  ANY key 
        while the search  is in progress  will terminate the  search and 
        display the message 'Text not found' on the bottom line. 
 
            If the text is found, the line containing it is displayed as 
        a high-intensity line (bright color) in the middle of the screen 
        depending on the value of the Find Row (see cloning section). 
 
            If the text is NOT  found, the command line (25)  is changed 
        to  say  '***  text  not  found  ***',  and  the display remains 
        unchanged. 
 
            To find the next occurrence of the same text, use the A)gain 
        command, or press the F3 key.  To find the previous  occurrence, 
        press the F9 key. 
 
            If the PCED keyboard  enhancement program is installed,  the 
        up/down cursor keys  may be used  to recall and  edit previously 
        entered Scan/Find text. 
 
            In  a  shared  file  environment,  if the file changes while 
        being listed,  the file  position may  become invalid.   Use the 
        HOME command to insure proper file synchronization,   or use the 
        alt-S command again. 
 
            If the display has been  scrolled right or left so  that the 
        "found"  text  is  not  visible,  you  will  see  an upside-down 
        question mark in the first column.  This is the same symbol that 
        is  displayed  on  a  blank  line  while  changing the Find/Scan 
        colors.  It  is there  so that  you can  tell that  the line  is 
        marked. 
 
        Summary of scanning commands: 
 
                /       Scan for text with exact match 
                v or '  Scan for text going backwards 
 
                \       Find text with case insensitive search 
                ^ or `  Find case insensitive text going backwards

Filtering 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            Filtering is the term used to describe the process that LIST 
        uses to  format file  data for  displaying on  a monitor.  After 
        data  is  read  from  a  file,  it  is  filtered.  The method of 
        filtering depends upon the options in effect. 
 
            For a typical ASCII  text file, the filter  removes carriage 
        return and line feed characters, and expands TAB characters. 
 
 

    Hi-bit Filter 
 
            The  7,  8,  and  *  (asterisk)  commands  determine whether 
        characters above ASCII-127 are displayed.  If the hi-bit  option 
        is off (7  command), the filter  strips the high  order bit from 
        each character.   If the  hi-bit option  is on  (8 command), all 
        characters, including  graphic characters  above ASCII-127,  are 
        displayed. 
 

    Star Filter 
 
            The  star  (*  or  asterisk)  command  displays  only  ASCII 
        characters below 128 (x'80'), but treats the special  characters 
        x'8A'  and  x'8D'  as  line-feed  and  carriage-return   control 
        characters.   Any  other  characters  above  127  are treated as 
        spaces, and control codes below ASCII-26 are replaced by blanks. 
 
            The Wrap option causes the filtering to insure that no  line 
        exceeds the width of the monitor, e.g. 80 characters. 
 

    Junk Filter 
 
            The alt-J  command toggles  the "junk"  filter which insures 
        that carriage  returns in  the file  also result  in a new line. 
        Also, backspace characters result in "backing up" the display by 
        one position.  This  allows more readability  of files that  use 
        backspacing to emphasize, or over-write, characters. 
 
 

    Hex Format Filter 
 
            The hex dump option (alt-H) causes the filtering to reformat 
        the file  data into  a DEBUG-like  display format.   The largest 
        file that can be displayed in Hex is 1 million bytes. 
 
            An  attempt  is  made  to  retain  the  file  position  when 
        switching from normal to hex-dump display, but due to  filtering 
        changing record lengths,  the hex display  may begin before  the 
        current record. 
 
        NOTE:   The  EOF  control character is  ignored in this version.

DOS considerations 
______________________________________________________________________________


    File Sharing 
 
            LIST uses  two techniques  for allowing  you to  share files 
        with   other   processes,   such   as   programs   running under 
        multi-tasking systems, in other windows, or on networks. 
 
            The first technique is called "file closing" and is  enabled 
        by the  alt-S commands.   This forces  LIST to  close the viewed 
        file unless it needs to read from the file.  If enough memory is 
        available, the entire file may be loaded once and thus leave the 
        file free for exclusive access by other processes. 
 
            The  second  technique  is  called  "file sharing".  It is a 
        function of  DOS and  requires DOS  version 3.0  or later.  LIST 
        opens the viewed  files with a  DENY NONE request.   This allows 
        other processes to  read and write  to the file  if they do  not 
        request exclusive use of the  file.  If a file is  not available 
        to  LIST  because  it  is  locked  by  another process, you will 
        receive the error message "File not found" or "Access  denied". 
        There is  no command  to enable  or disable  this method of file 
        sharing.  It is implicit with the use of DOS version 3. 
 

    Invoking DOS Commands 
 
            If the  "goto DOS"  option is  enabled, you  may invoke  DOS 
        commands by using the alt-G command.  LIST reserves about 60k of 
        memory  for   its  own   use.   This   increases  LIST's  memory 
        requirements  to  approximately  96k  when  using  alt-G.    The 
        remaining memory is available to the DOS commands. 
 
 
            After you have finished  entering DOS commands, use  the DOS 
        EXIT command to return to LIST. 
 
            To disable the  "goto DOS" function,  you must use  DEBUG to 
        alter the option  byte described in  the section about  cloning. 
        With it disabled, LIST requires less memory, about 66K. 
 

    Screen Saving 
 
            If  the  screen  saving  option  is  enabled, LIST saves the 
        contents of the current display screen when it starts.  You  can 
        restore  the  original  screen  by  exiting  LIST with the alt-X 
        command. 
 
            Screen saving requires approximately 10k more memory.   This 
        is sufficient to save 60 lines of 80 characters (EGA 8x6  mode). 
        See the section about cloning for information about enabling and 
        disabling the screen saving feature.

Cloning Procedure 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
            The screen colors, the display retrace testing (M), the file 
        closing (C) and ruler (alt-R) options may be permanently set  in 
        the program by using the alt-C cloning function. 
 
            For  cloning  to  take  effect, the program should be called 
        LIST.COM and on the current drive and in the current directory. 
 
            There are two versions of the LIST program file.  One is the 
        normal full program.  The  other, which  contains an  'S' as the 
        last letter of  the file name,  is a slightly  smaller file that 
        excludes  the  Help  screen.   You  may  use either COM file for 
        cloning.  After cloning, you may continue viewing the file. 
 
           The clonable options (command toggles) are: 
 
             M      =  Mono monitor, affects retrace testing. If you see 
                       "snow" on your color monitor, turn off this 
                       option 
 
             alt-S  =  file(s) are shared 
             W      =  Wrap long lines 
             8/7/*  =  display all 256 values, or 7-bit, or special case 
             K      =  flush Keyboard each time a command is read 
 
             alt-A  =  set on if using Apxcore, off if using Double Dos 
                       or TopView, or DesqView 
 
             alt-H  =  hex dump display, like the DEBUG format 
 
             alt-J  =  toggle "junk" filter, add LF to CR, fix backspaces 
 
             alt-L  =  set on to force preloading (reading) of the 
                       entire file before any lines are displayed, 
                       Default is OFF. 
 
             alt-N  =  toggles screen saving (see alt-X) feature 
 
             alt-R  =  toggle columnar ruler on top line 
 
             alt-T  =  toggle expansion of TAB characters 
 
 
        Note: Be  sure you  have no  other copies  of LIST.COM which are 
        accessible (because of a filepath type of utility).

 Locations of clonable values 

 
           An alternative to cloning is  to use DEBUG to make  permanent 
        changes.  Here is a list of key items and their addresses: 
 
           0127 - special lines 1 and 25 colors, default is 01 (blue) 
                  Refer to a technical reference guide for the 
                  attribute values for the colors that you want. 
           0129 - normal lines 2 thru 24 colors, default is 02 (green) 
           012B - bright color for Find/Scan, default is 0F (bright white) 
           012D - clonable options; 
               MRSJ WHK*  M = mono, retrace testing if off, x'01' 
                          R = ruler, x'02' 
                          S = shared, x'04' 
                          J = add LF to lone CR, process backspaces, 
                              if on, x'08'; default is off 
                          W = wrap mode, x'10' 
                          H = hi-bit on, x'20' 
                          K = kybd flush, x'40' 
                          * = special document filtering, x'80' 
           012E - more clonable options, not all are indicated: 
               .PAT DGV.  P = Preload file if on, x'02', default is off 
                          A = Apxcore if on, TV/DD/DV if off, x'04, 
                              default is for Topview/Double DOS use 
                          T = if on (default), expand TABs, x'08' 
                          D = hex display mode if on, x'10' 
                          G = if on, alt-G goto DOS is Disabled, x'20' 
                          V = if on, screen save/restore is Disabled 
                              and 9K less memory is used/required, x'40' 
 
        By  specifying  the  bit  value,  the  option  is  enabled.  For 
        example, to enable  Shared and Retrace,  specify a hex  value of 
        the sum, or 01+04 = 05. 
           012F - row less one at which found text is displayed,  1 byte 
                  the default is 08 which displays found text on line  9 
           0131 - scroll offset value,  default is 10 (x'0A'),  one byte 
           0133 - scroll starting value, default is 0 (x'00'), one byte 
           0135 - tab increment, must be power of 2, default is 8 
           0137 - tab mask, subtract tab incr from FFFFh,default is FFF8 
           0139 - beep tone, default is 512 (hex 0200) 
 
            When  the  Find/Scan  command  is  used, the next line which 
        contains that text is highlighted using the 'bright' color,  and 
        is placed in  row 9 of  the screen.  You  can change the  row by 
        altering the byte  at location 12F  which is normally  '08', one 
        less than the row. 
 
           0368 - WHAT eye-catcher 
           036C - WHAT keys/function table (see below)

Modifying LIST 
______________________________________________________________________________

 Reassigning keys 

 
        This information is offered to  those of you who wish  to modify 
        LIST in special ways.  You  do not need this information  to use 
        LIST. 
 
        LIST performs a function for every character that can be entered 
        at the command  line prompt.  There  are 128 regular  characters 
        and  131  extended  characters.   The  regular  characters   are 
        numbered from 0 to 127,  and they include the letters  A-Z, a-z, 
        the numbers, and the rest  of the usual single characters  found 
        on  your  keyboard.   The  extended characters represent special 
        function  keys  and  combinations  of  keys,  such as F1, alt-X, 
        ctrl-A, and the cursor positioning keys. 
 
        The  WHAT  table in LIST has  a one  byte entry  for each of the 
        characters.  This byte is a number from 0 to 57 that  represents 
        the identification of a routine that performs a function. 
 
        For example, 
 
          - the ESCape key has a value  of 27 (hex 1B) and its value  in 
            the WHAT table is 16 (10 hex).  Routine number 16 is  called 
            "Done".  The "Done" routine exits to DOS. 
 
          - the Q key has a value of 81 (51 hex) with a routine value of 
            15  for  the  "Close"  routine.   The  "Close"  routine ends 
            viewing of the  current file and  tries to display  the next 
            file, i.e. wildcards used for the filename.  There is also a 
            lower case letter q, so be sure to change both entries. 
 
 
        To change the  function that a  command character performs,  you 
        change the  value in  the WHAT  table for  the routine  that the 
        character invokes. 
 
        For example, to change the ESCape key to act like the Q key, you 
        change the routine value for ESCape from 16 (10 hex) to a 15 (0F 
        hex). 
 
        To find  the location  of the  routine value  in the WHAT table, 
        first determine the value of  the character, e.g.  ESCape is  27 
        (1B hex), and then  add that to the  location of the WHAT  table 
        (36C hex); or, 1B + 36C = 387 hex.  Finally, use DEBUG to change 
        the byte at that location (387 hex) from a 10 hex to a 0F hex. 
 
        For example, 
 
          debug list64a.com             ; use appropriate file name 
          -e 387 0f                     ; change ESC to routine 15 
          -w                            ; old data is 10 
          -q

             the screen saving option is enabled (default). 
 
          o  The line number is currently limited to 16 million lines. 
 
          o  The  file  size  is  limited  to 16 million bytes for ASCII 
             files, and to 4 million bytes for hex-dump files. 
 
          o  PC DOS Version 2.0 or later is required. DOS version 3.0 or 
             later is required for file sharing.
