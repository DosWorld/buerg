In this repository I collect all versions of the
DOS utilities published by Vernon D. Buerg from
the 1980s until the mid 2000s.

When the origin of the utility version is known
the commit message adding those files contains
the URL of the origin.

If you happen to have (a version of) a utility
not present here, please raise an issue and let
me know where to get hold of it, thank you!

Oh, and all utilities have been scanned with the
period correct Thunderbyte Anti-Virus 8.11. :)
