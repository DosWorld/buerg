In this repository I collect all published versions of
the shareware DOS utilities developed by Vernon Duncan
Buerg from the 1980s until the mid 2000s. At the time
he was renowned for developing the small and fast
file viewing and browsing utility [LIST](list/VERSIONS.md).

Together with his wife Julie Buerg he ran his
computer software company from Petaluma, CA.
The company

has been archived by archive.org

Besides being active on Compuserve
as [CIS:70007,1212](70007.1212@compuserve.com)
and developing [AUTOSIG](autosig/VERSIONS.md),
Buerg also ran
[VOR BBS](http://bbslist.textfiles.com/707/707.txt)
during the late 1990s for customer
support.

## The Buerg Utilities

<img align="right" width="200" height="217" src="imgs/butils.jpg">

When the origin of the utility version is known
the commit message adding those files contains
the URL of the origin.

The latest versions are tracked in the table
below, and the version history is available
for each utility.

If you happen to have (a version of) a utility
not present here, please raise an issue and let
me know where to get hold of it, thank you!

Oh, and all utilities have been scanned with the
period correct Thunderbyte Anti-Virus 8.11. :)
