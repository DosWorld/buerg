ARCF  Find Text in ARC Files.                      Version 1.0 - Oct 8, 1987




Purpose:  To search files in ARC archive files for text strings.


Format:   ARCF  [d:][path]filename[.ARC]  [filespecs...]  "text"
                [/B] [/C] [/F] [/Q] [/S] [/W]


Usage:    The d:path\filename and "text" parameters are required.
          The drive and path are optional. The 'filename' and
          'filespec' parameters may contain the wildcard characters *
          and ?. All files matching the 'filespec' specification
          within the 'filename' are processed.

          If the 'filename' extension is omitted, the extension .ARC
          is used.

          The 'text' search criteria must begin and end with a
|         double quote character, e.g. ARCF TEST.ARC "SOMETHING".

          The optional switch (/x) characters must be the last
          operands, e.g. ARCF TEST "april 1" /c/w.

          Normally, you would only want to search "text" files for
          strings. Text files consist of ASCII record. Each record
          ends in a carriage control (CR) character. The maximum
          record length is 4096 bytes. To search all files, binary
|         and text, use the /B option. A maximum of 80 characters
|         is display when text is found in a record.  If /B is used,
|         all control characters and hi-ASCII (greater than 127)
|         characters are blanked out.

                        Option Switches
                        ---------------

        /B - include Binary files, i.e. files with the extensions
             of .EXE, .COM, and .BIN. If omitted, only non-binary
             files are searched.

        /C - case sensitive search; if omitted, the search for the
             text is made regardless of the case, i.e. upper case
             and lower case letters are treated the same.

        /F - display the name of the file begin searched only if
             the scan text is found within the file; if omitted,
             the names of all files are displayed as they are
             proccesed.

        /G - supplies any encryption (garble) password, e.g.
             /GPSWD would supply PSWD as the password.

        /Q - suppress beeps and bells; if omitted, beeps are sent
             with error messages.

        /S - suppress displaying the names of the files being
|            processed; this includes suppressing the display
|            of the archive file name(s), too. When used with
|            /F, the only display is of the file name that
|            contains the search text.

        /W - ignore white-space; if omitted, spaces and tabs are
             significant.
