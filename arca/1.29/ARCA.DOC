ARCA Command                                            Version 1.29
------------                                            Dec 9,  1987

Purpose:  To create or add files to an ARC archive file.

Format:   ARCA  [drive:][path]arcname.ext  [filespecs...]  [/d]  [/m]

Remarks:  The drive and path names are optional. If omitted, the
        current drive and path name are used.

        The 'arcname' file name must be supplied.  The extension
        defaults to ARC.  All files matching the supplied filespecs are
        processed.  The input 'filespecs' may contain the * and ?
        wildcard characters.

        If an existing archive file is used, the specified input
        files are added to the end of it. There is no checking
        for duplicate filenames and existing archive member files
        are not replaced.  ARCA is best used when creating a brand-new
        archive.

        The /D option specifies that all input files be deleted.  The
        files are deleted after successful processing of all of the
        input files.

        Invoking ARCA with no arguments yields a terse summary of
        the needed parameters, along with a version header.

        ARCA uses only 2 compression techniques: a modified LZW
        compression algorithm and repeated-string compression
        ("packing").  The LZW algorithm is the same as the one used by
        ARC, but modifications have been made to improve its compression
        performance, especially when dealing with files containing
        more "random" data such as executable files, though compression
        performance for files containing less random data such as
        textual files suffers a bit, but not much.  ARCA generally
        performs better than ARC does -- it's significantly faster than
        ARC while yielding smaller archives (hard to imagine getting
        the best of two worlds!)

        Experiments have shown that the modified LZW compression algorithm
        generally compresses binary files better than the Huffman algorithm
        ("squeezing") can, Huffman compression is not used at all. If the
        LZW compression fails to yield a smaller file, then packing is used
        instead.  There are cases where a packed file is larger than the
        original file, but these cases don't happen often enough for ARCA to
        handle, for example, by copying the unchanged file to the archive.

        Though ARCA uses an improved LZW algorithm, its output is TOTALLY
        compatible with the one used by System Enhancements Associates'
        (21 New Street, Wayne NJ 07470) ARC program, which means that ARCs
        created by ARCA can be processed by ARC, or by ARCE and ARCV
        (companion extraction & table-of-contents lister programs also
        written by Vernon Buerg and Wayne Chin).

------------                                            Dec 9,  1987


                        Examples
                        --------

        o  Create an archive file called TEST.ARC, and place all
           files from the current directory into it:

              ARCA TEST *.*

        o  Create an archive called SOURCE.ARC in the subdirectory
           \SAVE on drive B, and place all files with an extension
           of ASM into to:

              ARCA B:\SAVE\SOURCE *.ASM


        o  Add files to the archive on drive A called PROGA.ARC all
           files in subdirectory \TEST on drive C, all files with a
           filename beginning with NE, and all file from the subdirectory
           \OLD on drive B:

              ARCA A:PROGA.ARC C:\TEST\*.* NE*.* B:\OLD\*.*

                        Error Messages
                        --------------

    ARCA: filename, analyzing, compressed.
        This message is issued for each 'filename' added to
        the archive file using LZW data compression. The program
        continues.

    ARCA: filename, analyzing, packed.
        This message is issued for each 'filename' added to
        the archive file using repeated-string compression.  The
        program continues.

    ARCA: No matching files!
        No files were found that matched one of the 'filespecs'
        in the command line. The program terminates.

    ARCA: You must use DOS version 2.0 or higher.
        DOS version 2.0 or higher is required. The program terminates.

    ARCA: Insufficient memory.
        A minimum of 34k is required. The program terminates.

    ARCA: Shrink failed.
        This error should not occur. If it does, there is a problem
        with DOS. The program terminates.


    ARCA: Can't create archive file.
        There is no room in the target directory to create the
        specified archive file, or the target disk has become full.

    ARCA: Write error -- no more disk space? Don't trust this archive!
        ARCA has encountered a problem writing to the target disk.  Check
        if there's sufficient room on the target disk to contain the full
        archive or delete unneeded files to free up some space.  ARCA
        terminates leaving behind an archive that may not be usable --
        check it carefully if you still want to use it (check the archive
        by using ARCV or ARCE).

ARCA Command                                            Version 1.29

        As mentioned, ARCA is intended to be used to create a NEW archive,
        not for appending or updating an existing archive, though ARCA does
        not prevent you from doing so -- ARCA simply appends new files to the
        named archive without deleting existing entries.  To properly append
        or to update, you should use ARC instead.

        There may be two COM files. The ARCA286.COM file is for 80286 based
        systems only.
