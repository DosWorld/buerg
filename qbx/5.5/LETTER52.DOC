Dear Vernon,

Here is my second cut at the BC7 version of QBX.  I have added the /E option
at your suggestion and also the /? option as I always forget the switches and
the doc file is not always on hand quickly.

I think that this will wrap up the needed changes for BC7.  I will be waiting
to see what the others come in with before I sign off on the code however.

Talk to you later,

David
