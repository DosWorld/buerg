Dear Vernon,

Here is my third cut at the BC7 version of QBX.  I have added the /K option
to find the Keywords in use in a program.  QBX was already doing this, so I
just had to add a l;ittle logic to track them.  I also added full DOS path
support for the Source file location and full WILD CARD support in the name. 
The program now loop thru all files that match the soure spec.  Also I added
support for the INCLUDE environment variable to locate the include files.

I though that yesterdays version was the last, but I had a few more ideas!

Talk to you later,

David
