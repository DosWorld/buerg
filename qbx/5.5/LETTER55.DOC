Dear Vernon,

Here is my fifth cut at the BC7 version of QBX.  Here I have added the /B
switch.  This is for people who use the BASIC environment and have line
numbers on all of their code.  It uses the BASIC line number, rather then
statment number, for the cross reference and listing.

I have also places UPC back in assembly code.  This is a new UPC routine.  I
have to make it compatible with BC7's Far String type. It works the same but
the addressing is different.

Talk to you later,

David
