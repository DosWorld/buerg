Dear Vernon,

Here is my first cut at the BC7 version of QBX.  I have had to make some
changes do to the nature of BC7 and the way it allocates memory.

I have placed the "xrefs" back in basic memory, in a far numeric array.  BC7
would not work with your xref121 file. The program would not allocate any
memory for the array.

I have also replaced the 3 sort routines with QuickSorts.  I think this is a
faster way to handle the sorting.

You will notice a list of words in the bottom of the file.  These are the
keywords for the BC7 librarys.  Please let me know if you think they should
go in the Keyword list, or just let them be found as a subroutine call.

I have commented some of the changes I made with either "5.00" or "DME".

I hope to hear from you soon.  I will continue to refine the program as I
have time and if I find any bugs.

Thank you for this chance to help you for a change, as you have helped me
many times without even knowing it.

David


P.S. The NO*.obj files in the GO.BAT file are provided with the BC7 compiler.
They help to reduce the EXE size by removing un-wanted code.
