  (c) Copyright Vernon D. Buerg 1986, 1987.               June 21,  1987
  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.



  Purpose
  -------

        Determines cross references to alphanumeric labels and symbols
        within a BASIC source program.

  Syntax
  ------

        QBX [filename[.BAS]]  [/D]          [/Lnn]  [/Cnnn]
                              [/P]
                              [/F[(filename)]]
                              [/N]

  Remarks
  -------

        If no filename is supplied, you are prompted to enter the
        file name of the BASIC source file. The source file must
        have been saved in ASCII (,A) format. The program may contain
        any valid combination of numeric and alphameric labels. The
        syntax is dictated by the Microsoft Quick Basic Compiler manual
        and the IBM BASIC, Version 3.1, manual.

        The source file may contain TAB characters but their use
        may cause the listing to be mis-aligned.

        The output consists of a program listing and a cross-reference
        listing. The destination for the listing may be specified in
        the command as:

                /D  display listings on the console display
                /P  print the listings on the LPT1: printer
                /F  write the listings to a file; may be supplied as (filename)
                /N  suppress all listings

        For example, /F(MYPROG.LST) sets a destination of a file with
        the name MYPROG.LST. If no extension is supplied, .LST is used
        for the program listing and .REF is used for the cross-reference
        listing.

        If no destination parameter is supplied, you will be asked to supply
        it.

        The number of lines per page may be suppied by the /L parameter,
        for example /L66 sets a default of 66 lines per page.

        The number of columns per line may be supplied by the /C parameter,
        for example /C132 sets a default of 133 columns per line.




  Meta Commands
  -------------

        The source file may contain the meta commands described in
        the Quick Basic (versions 1 or 2) manuals. These meta commands
        are currently recognized:

                $INCLUDE  - cause QBX to include the named file with
                            the current source program, and may be nested
                            to approximately 15 levels;
                $LINESIZE - sets the number of characters per page;
                $PAGESIZE - sets the number of program lines per page;

                $PAGE     - forces a new listing page
                $SKIP     - inserts one blank line into the listing
                $SKIP:n   - inserts "n" blank lines into the listing
                $SUBTITLE - adds a subtitle to each listing page second line
                $TITLE    - adds a title to each listing page; if none
                            are supplied, the title is "QBX"

  Operation
  ---------

        There are two parts to the operation of QBX. The first phase
        produces a program listing and builds the internal tables
        representing the program's labels and symbols. The second
        phase produces a label and a symbol cross reference.

        The output from each phase may be directed to the screen,
        a printer (LPT1), a file, or nowhere. You are prompted for
        the destination.

        The format of the listings is governed by two values: the
        number of lines per page, and the number of columns per line.
        You supply  both values. The defaults are 66 lines per page
        and 80 columns. You may over-ride these values by using the
        meta commands $PAGESIZE and $LINESIZE in the program. If the
        console is used for output, the values are always set to 24
        lines and 80 columns with an option at the end of each page
        to pause or continue.

        You must set your printer to the appropriate lines and columns
        values before running QBX. It does not send any printer codes.

        The internal tables contain the labels, symbols, and cross
        reference information. The current limits are 2500 labels and
        symbols, and approximately 16000 cross references (depends
        upon the amount of memory available. There is also a limit
        off 200 fields per statement. A field is a symbol, label,
        delimiter, or operator. These values are summarized at the
        end of program execution.

|       You may terminate processing by pressing the ESCape key.

        QBX was written using the Microsoft Quick Basic Compiler,
        Version 2.01, and one assembler subroutine. At least 128K
        of memory is required, but 192K or more is recommended. The
        additional memory is used to increase the limits of the numbers
        of labels, symbols and cross references that QBX can process.


        QBX is  supplied  for  personal,  private  use. Feel free to
        distribute QBX given these restrictions:

          o  the program  shall be supplied in its original,  unmodified
             form, which includes this documentation;

          o  no fee is charged;

          o  "commmercial" use without a license is prohibited;

          o  the program may not be included -  or bundled - with  other
